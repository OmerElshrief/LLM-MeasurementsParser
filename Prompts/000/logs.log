BACKGROUND Molecular response is a calculation of the change in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels observed in samples collected from subjects at different time points. In certain cases, the calculation is based on the fraction of somatic variants in the total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in samples. In other cases, the calculation is based on the concentration of ctDNA in the samples (i.e., normalized per the cfDNA concentration in the samples). A common problem associated with these approaches is that these relatively simple calculations of molecular response frequently yield inaccurate or imprecise molecular response scores. Thus, there remains a need for methods for accurately determining molecular response scores for subjects having cancer.

Adapter: As used herein, “adapter” refers to short nucleic acids (e.g., less than about 500, less than about 100 or less than about 50 nucleotides in length) that are typically at least partially double-stranded and used to link to either or both ends of a given sample nucleic acid molecule. Adapters can include nucleic acid primer binding sites to permit amplification of a nucleic acid molecule flanked by adapters at both ends, and/or a sequencing primer binding site, including primer binding sites for sequencing applications, such as various next generation sequencing (NGS) applications. Adapters can also include binding sites for capture probes, such as an oligonucleotide attached to a flow cell support or the like. Adapters can also include a nucleic acid tag as described herein. Nucleic acid tags are typically positioned relative to amplification primer and sequencing primer binding sites, such that a nucleic acid tag is included in amplicons and sequencing reads of a given nucleic acid molecule. The same or different adapters can be linked to the respective ends of a nucleic acid molecule. In certain embodiments, the same adapter is linked to the respective ends of the nucleic acid molecule except that the nucleic acid tag differs. In some embodiments, the adapter is a Y-shaped adapter in which one end is blunt ended or tailed as described herein, for joining to a nucleic acid molecule, which is also blunt ended or tailed with one or more complementary nucleotides. In still other exemplary embodiments, an adapter is a bell-shaped adapter that includes a blunt or tailed end for joining to a nucleic acid molecule to be analyzed. Other exemplary adapters include T-tailed and C-tailed adapters. Administer: As used herein, “administer” or “administering” a therapeutic agent (e.g., an immunological therapeutic agent) to a subject means to give, apply or bring the composition into contact with the subject.

For example, if a polynucleotide is DNA, it can be genomic DNA, complementary DNA (cDNA), or any other deoxyribonucleic acid. A polynucleotide can also be a cell-free nucleic acid such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). For example, the polynucleotide can be circulating cfDNA. Circulating cfDNA may comprise DNA shed from bodily cells via apoptosis or necrosis. cfDNA shed via apoptosis or necrosis may originate from normal (e.g. healthy) bodily cells. Where there is abnormal tissue growth, such as for cancer, tumor DNA may be shed. The circulating cfDNA can comprise circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). i. Samples Isolation and extraction of cell free polynucleotides may be performed through collection of samples using a variety of techniques. A sample can be any biological sample isolated from a subject. Samples can include body tissues, whole blood, platelets, serum, plasma, stool, red blood cells, white blood cells or leucocytes, endothelial cells, tissue biopsies (e.g., biopsies from known or suspected solid tumors), cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, lymphatic fluid, ascites fluid, interstitial or extracellular fluid (e.g., fluid from intercellular spaces), gingival fluid, crevicular fluid, bone marrow, pleural effusions, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, mucous, sputum, semen, sweat, urine. Samples are preferably body fluids, particularly blood and fractions thereof, and urine. Such samples include nucleic acids shed from tumors. The nucleic acids can include DNA and RNA and can be in double and single-stranded forms. A sample can be in the form originally isolated from a subject or can have been subjected to further processing to remove or add components, such as cells, enrich for one component relative to another, or convert one form of nucleic acid to another, such as RNA to DNA or single-stranded nucleic acids to double-stranded. Thus, for example, a body fluid sample for analysis is plasma or serum containing cell-free nucleic acids, e.g., cell-free DNA (cfDNA). In some embodiments, the sample volume of body fluid taken from a subject depends on the desired read depth for sequenced regions. Exemplary volumes are about 0.4-40 ml, about 5-20 ml, about 10-20 ml. For example, the volume can be about 0.5 ml, about 1 ml, about 5 ml, about 10 ml, about 20 ml, about 30 ml, about 40 ml, or more milliliters. A volume of sampled blood is typically between about 5 ml to about 20 ml. The sample can comprise, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Generally, after addition of buffers and wash steps, cell-free nucleic acids are precipitated with, for example, an alcohol. In certain embodiments, additional clean up steps are used, such as silica-based columns to remove contaminants or salts. Non-specific bulk carrier nucleic acids, for example, are optionally added throughout the reaction to optimize certain aspects of the exemplary procedure, such as yield. After such processing, samples typically include various forms of nucleic acids including double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA and/or single-stranded RNA. Optionally, single stranded DNA and/or single stranded RNA are converted to double stranded forms so that they are included in subsequent processing and analysis steps. Additional details regarding cfDNA partitioning and related analysis of epigenetic modifications that are optionally adapted for use in performing the methods disclosed herein are described in, for example, WO 2018/119452, filed Dec. 22, 2017, which is incorporated by reference. ii. Nucleic Acid Tags In certain embodiments, tags providing molecular identifiers or barcodes are incorporated into or otherwise joined to adapters by chemical synthesis, ligation, or overlap extension PCR, among other methods. In some embodiments, the assignment of unique or non-unique identifiers, or molecular barcodes in reactions follows methods and utilizes systems described in, for example, US patent applications 20010053519, 20030152490, 20110160078, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,582,908, 7,537,898, and 9,598,731, which are each incorporated by reference. Tags are linked (e.g., ligated) to sample nucleic acids randomly or non-randomly. In some embodiments, tags are introduced at an expected ratio of identifiers (e.g., a combination of unique and/or non-unique barcodes) to microwells. For example, the identifiers may be loaded so that more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers are loaded per genome sample. In some embodiments, the identifiers are loaded so that less than about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers are loaded per genome sample. In certain embodiments, the average number of identifiers loaded per sample genome is less than, or greater than, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers per genome sample. The identifiers are generally unique or non-unique. One exemplary format uses from about 2 to about 1,000,000 different tags, or from about 5 to about 150 different tags, or from about 20 to about 50 different tags, ligated to both ends of a target nucleic acid molecule. For 20-50×20-50 tags, a total of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Such numbers of tags are typically sufficient for different molecules having the same start and stop points to have a high probability (e.g., at least 94%, 99.5%, 99.99%, 99.999%) of receiving different combinations of tags. In some embodiments, identifiers are predetermined, random, or semi-random sequence oligonucleotides. In other embodiments, a plurality of barcodes may be used such that barcodes are not necessarily unique to one another in the plurality. In these embodiments, barcodes are generally attached (e.g., by ligation or PCR amplification) to individual molecules such that the combination of the barcode and the sequence it may be attached to creates a unique sequence that may be individually tracked. As described herein, detection of non-uniquely tagged barcodes in combination with sequence data of beginning (start) and end (stop) portions of sequence reads typically allows for the assignment of a unique identity to a particular molecule. The length, or number of base pairs, of an individual sequence read are also optionally used to assign a unique identity to a given molecule. As described herein, fragments from a single strand of nucleic acid having been assigned a unique identity, may thereby permit subsequent identification of fragments from the parent strand, and/or a complementary strand. iii. Nucleic Acid Amplification Sample nucleic acids flanked by adapters are typically amplified by PCR and other amplification methods using nucleic acid primers binding to primer binding sites in adapters flanking a DNA molecule to be amplified. In some embodiments, amplification methods involve cycles of extension, denaturation and annealing resulting from thermocycling, or can be isothermal as, for example, in transcription mediated amplification. Other exemplary amplification methods that are optionally utilized, include the ligase chain reaction, strand displacement amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and self-sustained sequence-based replication, among other approaches. One or more rounds of amplification cycles are generally applied to introduce sample indexes/tags to a nucleic acid molecule using conventional nucleic acid amplification methods. The amplifications are typically conducted in one or more reaction mixtures. In some embodiments, molecular tags and sample indexes/tags are introduced prior to and/or after sequence capturing steps are performed. In some embodiments, only the molecular tags are introduced prior to probe capturing and the sample indexes/tags are introduced after sequence capturing steps are performed. In certain embodiments, both the molecular tags and the sample indexes/tags are introduced prior to performing probe-based capturing steps. In some embodiments, the sample indexes/tags are introduced after sequence capturing steps (i.e., enrichment of nucleic acids) are performed. Typically, sequence capturing protocols involve introducing a single-stranded nucleic, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Typically, the amplification reactions generate a plurality of non-uniquely or uniquely tagged nucleic acid amplicons with molecular tags and sample indexes/tags at size ranging from about 200 nucleotides (nt) to about 700 nt, from 250 nt to about 350 nt, or from about 320 nt to about 550 nt. In some embodiments, the amplicons have a size of about 300 nt. In some embodiments, the amplicons have a size of about 500 nt. iv. Nucleic Acid Enrichment In some embodiments, sequences are enriched prior to sequencing the nucleic acids. Enrichment is optionally performed for specific target regions or nonspecifically (“target sequences”). By way of example, enrichment may be performed nonspecifically based on a size selection method that is not sequence specific but rather is sequence fragment size specific. In some embodiments, targeted regions of interest may be enriched with nucleic acid capture probes (“baits”) selected for one or more bait set panels using a differential tiling and capture scheme. A differential tiling and capture scheme generally uses bait sets of different relative concentrations to differentially tile (e.g., at different “resolutions”) across genomic sections associated with the baits, subject to a set of constraints (e.g., sequencer constraints such as sequencing load, utility of each bait, etc.), and capture the targeted nucleic acids at a desired level for downstream sequencing. These targeted genomic sections of interest optionally include natural or synthetic nucleotide sequences of the nucleic acid construct. In some embodiments, biotin-labeled beads with probes to one or more sections of interest can be used to capture target sequences, and optionally followed by amplification of those sections, to enrich for the regions of interest. Sequence capture typically involves the use of oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the target nucleic acid sequence. In certain embodiments, a probe set strategy involves tiling the probes across a section of interest. Such probes can be, for example, from about 60 to about 120 nucleotides in length. The set can have a depth of about 2×, 3×, 4×, 5×, 6×, 8×, 9×, 10×, 15×, 20×, 50× or more. The effectiveness of sequence capture generally depends, in part, on the length of the sequence in the target molecule that is complementary (or nearly complementary) to the sequence of the probe. b. Nucleic Acid Sequencing As shown in  FIG.  1 101 102 103 104 The sequencing reactions can be performed on one more nucleic acid fragment types or sections known to contain markers of cancer or of other diseases. The sequencing reactions can also be performed on any nucleic acid fragment present in the sample. The sequence reactions may provide for sequence coverage of the genome of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%,, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,281 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textwhose sequence has been determined. Sequencing can be performed so as to provide sequence data of individual nucleic acid molecules in a sample either directly or indirectly from a consensus sequence of amplification products of an individual nucleic acid molecule in the sample. In some embodiments, double-stranded nucleic acids with single-stranded overhangs in a sample after blunt-end formation are linked at both ends to adapters including barcodes, and the sequencing determines nucleic acid sequences as well as in-line barcodes introduced by the adapters. The blunt-end DNA molecules are optionally ligated to a blunt end of an at least partially double-stranded adapter (e.g., a Y shaped or bell-shaped adapter). Alternatively, blunt ends of sample nucleic acids and adapters can be tailed with complementary nucleotides to facilitate ligation (e.g., sticky end ligation). The nucleic acid sample is typically contacted with a sufficient number of adapters such that there is a low probability (e.g., <1 or 0.1%) that any two copies of the same nucleic acid receive the same combination of adapter barcodes from the adapters linked at both ends. The use of adapters in this manner permits identification of families of nucleic acid sequences with the same start and stop points on a reference nucleic acid and linked to the same combination of barcodes. Such a family represents sequences of amplification products of a template/parent nucleic acid in the sample before amplification. The sequences of family members can be compiled to derive consensus nucleotide(s) or a complete consensus sequence for a nucleic acid molecule in the original sample, as modified by blunt end formation and adapter attachment. In other words, the nucleotide occupying a specified position of a nucleic acid in the sample is determined to be the consensus of nucleotides occupying that corresponding position in family member sequences. Families can include sequences of one or both strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid. If members of a family include sequences of both strands from a double-stranded nucleic acid, sequences of one strand are converted to their complement for purposes of compiling all sequences to derive consensus nucleotide(s) or sequences. Some families include only a single member sequence. In this case, this sequence can be taken as the sequence of a nucleic acid in the sample before amplification. Alternatively, families with only a single member sequence may be eliminated from subsequent analysis. Nucleotide variations in sequenced nucleic acids can be determined by comparing sequenced nucleic acids with a reference sequence. The reference sequence is often a known sequence, e.g., a known whole or partial genome sequence from a subject (e.g., a whole genome sequence of a human subject). The reference sequence can be, for example, hG19 or hG38.

Examples of suitable panel and targets for use in panels can be found in the epigenetic targets described in U.S. provisional patent application 62/799,637, filed Jan. 31, 2019, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some aspects, a panel that targets a plurality of different genes or genomic regions (e.g., transcriptional factor binding regions, distal regulatory elements (DREs), repetitive elements, intron-exon junctions, transcriptional start sites (TSSs), and/or the like) is selected such that a determined proportion of subjects having a cancer exhibits a genetic variant or tumor marker in one or more different genes in the panel. The panel may be selected to limit a region for sequencing to a fixed number of base pairs. The panel may be selected to sequence a desired amount of DNA. The panel may be further selected to achieve a desired sequence read depth. The panel may be selected to achieve a desired sequence read depth or sequence read coverage for an amount of sequenced base pairs. The panel may be selected to achieve a theoretical sensitivity, a theoretical specificity, and/or a theoretical accuracy for detecting one or more genetic variants in a sample. Probes for detecting the panel of regions can include those for detecting genomic regions of interest (hotspot regions) as well as nucleosome-aware probes (e.g., KRAS codons  12 13 Some examples of listings of genomic locations of interest may be found in Table 1 and Table 2.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,284 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textIn some embodiments, the one or more regions in the panel comprise one or more loci from one or a plurality of genes for detecting residual cancer after surgery. This detection can be earlier than is possible for existing methods of cancer detection. In some embodiments, the one or more genomic locations in the panel comprise one or more loci from one or a plurality of genes for detecting cancer in a high-risk patient population. For example, smokers have much higher rates of lung cancer than the general population. Moreover, smokers can develop other lung conditions that make cancer detection more difficult, such as the development of irregular nodules in the lungs. In some embodiments, the methods described herein detect the response of patients to cancer therapy (particularly in high risk patients) earlier than is possible for existing methods of cancer detection. A genomic location may be selected for inclusion in a sequencing panel based on a number of subjects with a cancer that have a tumor marker in that gene or region. A genomic location may be selected for inclusion in a sequencing panel based on prevalence of subjects with a cancer and a tumor marker present in that gene. Presence of a tumor marker in a region may be indicative of a subject having cancer. In some instances, the panel may be selected using information from one or more databases. The information regarding a cancer may be derived from cancer tumor biopsies or cfDNA assays. A database may comprise information describing a population of sequenced tumor samples. A database may comprise information about mRNA expression in tumor samples. A database may comprise information about regulatory elements or genomic regions in tumor samples. The information relating to the sequenced tumor samples may include the frequency of various genetic variants and describe the genes or regions in which the genetic variants occur. The genetic variants may be tumor markers. A non-limiting example of such a database is COSMIC. COSMIC is a catalogue of somatic mutations found in various cancers. For a particular cancer, COSMIC ranks genes based on frequency of mutation. A gene may be selected for inclusion in a panel by having a high frequency of mutation within a given gene. For instance, COSMIC indicates that 33% of a population of sequenced breast cancer samples have a mutation in TP53 and 22% of a population of sampled breast cancers have a mutation in KRAS. Other ranked genes, including APC, have mutations found only in about 4% of a population of sequenced breast cancer samples. TP53 and KRAS may be included in a sequencing panel based on having relatively high frequency among sampled breast cancers (compared to APC, for example, which occurs at a frequency of about 4%). COSMIC is provided as a non-limiting example, however, any database or set of information may be used that associates a cancer with tumor marker located in a gene or genetic region.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,285 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textCOSMIC, of 1156 biliary tract cancer samples, 380 samples (33%) carried mutations in TP53. Several other genes, such as APC, have mutations in 4-8% of all samples. Thus, TP53 may be selected for inclusion in the panel based on a relatively high frequency in a population of biliary tract cancer samples. A gene or genomic section may be selected for a panel where the frequency of a tumor marker is significantly greater in sampled tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA than found in a given background population. A combination of genomic locations may be selected for inclusion of a panel such that at least a majority of subjects having a cancer may have a tumor marker or genomic region present in at least one of the genomic location or genes in the panel. The combination of genomic location may be selected based on data indicating that, for a particular cancer or set of cancers, a majority of subjects have one or more tumor markers in one or more of the selected regions. For example, to detect cancer 1, a panel comprising regions A, B, C, and/or D may be selected based on data indicating that 90% of subjects with cancer 1 have a tumor marker in regions A, B, C, and/or D of the panel. Alternately, tumor markers may be shown to occur independently in two or more regions in subjects having a cancer such that, combined, a tumor marker in the two or more regions is present in a majority of a population of subjects having a cancer. For example, to detect cancer 2, a panel comprising regions X, Y, and Z may be selected based on data indicating that 90% of subjects have a tumor marker in one or more regions, and in 30% of such subjects a tumor marker is detected only in region X, while tumor markers are detected only in regions Y and/or Z for the remainder of the subjects for whom a tumor marker was detected. Tumor markers present in one or more genomic locations previously shown to be associated with one or more cancers may be indicative of or predictive of a subject having cancer if a tumor marker is detected in one or more of those regions 50% or more of the time. Computational approaches such as models employing conditional probabilities of detecting cancer given a cancer frequency for a set of tumor markers within one or more regions may be used to predict which regions, alone or in combination, may be predictive of cancer. Other approaches for panel selection involve the use of databases describing information from studies employing comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors with large panels and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS, RNA-seq, Chip-seq, bisulfate sequencing, ATAC-seq, and others). Information gleaned from literature may also describe pathways commonly affected and mutated in certain cancers. Panel selection may be further informed by the use of ontologies describing genetic information. Genes included in the panel for sequencing can include the fully transcribed region, the promoter region, enhancer regions, regulatory elements, and/or, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Software to perform mapping or aligning (e.g., Bowtie, BWA, mrsFAST, BLAST, BLAT) can associate a sequencing read with a genetic locus. After the sequence read coverage has been determined, a stochastic modeling algorithm may be applied to convert the normalized nucleic acid sequence read coverage for each window/bin region to the discrete copy number states. In some cases, this algorithm may comprise one or more of the following: Hidden Markov Model, dynamic programming, support vector machine, Bayesian network, trellis decoding, Viterbi decoding, expectation maximization, Kalman filtering methodologies and neural networks. The discrete copy number states of each window region can be utilized to identify copy number variation in the chromosomal regions. In some cases, all adjacent window/bin regions with the same copy number can be merged into a segment to report the presence or absence of copy number variation state. In some cases, various windows/bins can be filtered before they are merged with other segments. Copy number variation may be used to report a percentage score indicating how much disease material (or nucleic acids having a copy number variation) exists in a cell free polynucleotide sample. In an embodiment, the existence of CNVs in one or more genes may be used to exclude variants from further analysis.

Common approaches for CHIP filtering leverages recurrent CHIP genes or hotspots curated by large public or internal cohort studies. However, these approaches do not address challenges in identifying random CHIP mutations in a plasma only approach. Residual unfiltered CHIP variants would bias the fractional change towards 1 (unchanged) and thus yield inaccurate subsequent molecular response prediction. To filter private CHIP variants (e.g., a variant that is CHIP but has not been documented ever or not often in previous databases of known CHIP variants), mutation measurement between two timepoints can be used to cluster variants of similar fractional change. When a patient receive treatment, progression or response will result in fractional somatic mutation while CHIP variant will remain stable. By clustering mutations into clones, random CHIP variants can be found in clones with enrichment of known CHIP list or in clones with stable fractional difference. Accordingly, provided herein is an improvement in CHIP filtering that leverages the observations between two timepoints (T 0  1 In one embodiment, the genomic mutations/variants are clustered utilizing a novel agglomerative hierarchical clustering heuristic. The heuristic quantifies the statistical dissimilarity between mutations/variants and clusters via a custom dissimilarity metric. A tunable stopping rule is utilized which continues agglomeration until a minimum (or maximum, depending upon the metric) allowable dissimilarity threshold is met. In one embodiment, the custom dissimilarity metric is a modification of the Bhattacharyya distance such that a numerical integration is performed with respect to the product (not subjected to a square root) of the scaled likelihoods of the mutations/variants and/or clusters that are under consideration to be merged at a given step of the clustering heuristic. The likelihoods are scaled to numerically integrate to 1 over the support of the integration. For SNVs and indels, the likelihood is calculated with respect to a Beta-Binomial model approximation of the observed count data that informs the MAF determination for the variants being clustered. The dispersion of the Beta-Binomial model is set via a tunable parameter. For CNVs, the likelihood is calculated with respect to a Gaussian model approximation of the observed fold change estimates of the mutations of interest, with the variability of Gaussian model also set via a tunable parameter. The agglomeration of mutations is conducted in a novel fashion such that, in some instances, clustering is performed via a tiered approach, in which a first set of mutations is clustered until the stopping rule is met and then a second set of mutations is introduced and further agglomerative steps are possibly performed according to the same dissimilarity metric and stopping rule.

Therefore, for this subject, the molecular response should be considered “molecular non-responder.” The method  100 100 100 100 100 In other exemplary embodiments, variance is incorporated into the molecular response calculation through simulation or sampling from the variance distribution of at least one variant to calculate the molecular response variance. As further disclosed herein, some applications include weighting variants based on their importance in the tumor or likelihood of tumor vs clonal hematopoeisis. Some embodiments involve integrating multiple genomic data sources to estimate tumor fraction (instead of just relying on variant (e.g., SNV, Indel and Fusion) VAFs), coverage (e.g., copy number), off-target coverage, and/or methylation, among other genomic data sources. In some embodiments, the methods include using one or more additional genomic data sources to determine the molecular response score for the subject having the cancer. In some embodiments, the additional genomic data sources comprise one or more of: a coverage, an off-target coverage, an epigenetic signature, tumor mutational burden and/or a microsatellite instability score. For a data source, there can be a calculation of tumor fraction based on that data source, and the calculated tumor fraction may be combined across data sources (for example using a weighted mean, incorporating the confidence of a data source in the tumor fraction for that particular sample), and then the overall tumor fraction estimate in a sample may be combined to calculate an overall molecular response. In some embodiments, the epigenetic signature comprises a cfNA fragment length, position, and/or endpoint density distribution. In some embodiments, the epigenetic signature comprises an epigenetic state or status exhibited by one or more epigenetic loci in a given targeted genomic region. In some embodiments, the epigenetic state or status comprises a presence or absence of methylation, hydroxymethylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation, citrullination, and/or a histone post-translational modification or other histone variation.

For example, molecular response is typically measured by allele frequency of genomic alternations (e.g., small variants between two time points) to represent tumor fractional change. Given that cfDNA signal is an aggregation of signal from essentially any cell types, including tumor, blood cell, and the like, numerous studies have shown the presence of clonal hematopoiesis of intermediate potential (CHIP) variants in cfDNA samples. Common approaches for CHIP filtering frequently leverage recurrent CHIP genes or hotspots curated by various data sources. However, it is yet a challenge to identify random CHIP mutations with a plasma only approach. Residual unfiltered CHIP variants typically bias the fractional change towards 1 (unchanged) and thus yield inaccurate molecular response prediction or scores. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein use a model to leverage the observations between two time points to cluster genomic mutations in clones with separate fractional change. To group mutations, these approaches typically leverage the variant allele count and total count for a variant from the two time points and build a probability density function for tumor fraction change R as P(R). As a further illustration,  FIG.  13 1300 1301 1300 1302 1303 1304 In other aspect, this disclosure provides methods of identifying and excluding germline variants, or otherwise resolving somatic classification discrepancies when determining molecular response scores. For example, one problem is that samples collected over the course of a patient's treatment course typically have differing levels of tumor shedding and allele imbalance, meaning that a somatic variant caller of a given bioinformatics pipeline will sometimes arrive at differing somatic classifications for the same variant in the same patient. Since an aim of molecular response determinations is to track the somatic variants over the course of treatment, any classification discrepancies should be resolved to properly remove germline variants from consideration.

Essentially any cancer therapy (e.g., surgical therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or the like) is included as part of these methods. In certain embodiments, the therapy administered to a subject may comprise at least one chemotherapy drug. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy drug may comprise alkylating agents (for example, but not limited to, Chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Cisplatin and Carboplatin), nitrosoureas (for example, but not limited to, Carmustine and Lomustine), anti-metabolites (for example, but not limited to, Fluorauracil, Methotrexate and Fludarabine), plant alkaloids and natural products (for example, but not limited to, Vincristine, Paclitaxel and Topotecan), anti-tumor antibiotics (for example, but not limited to, Bleomycin, Doxorubicin and Mitoxantrone), hormonal agents (for example, but not limited to, Prednisone, Dexamethasone, Tamoxifen and Leuprolide) and biological response modifiers (for example, but not limited to, Herceptin and Avastin, Erbitux and Rituxan). In some embodiments, the chemotherapy administered to a subject may comprise FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. In certain embodiments, a therapy may be administered to a subject that comprises at least one PARP inhibitor. In certain embodiments, the PARP inhibitor may include OLAPARIB, TALAZOPARIB, RUCAPARIB, NIRAPARIB (trade name ZEJULA), among others. Typically, therapies include at least one immunotherapy (or an immunotherapeutic agent). Immunotherapy refers generally to methods of enhancing an immune response against a given cancer type. In certain embodiments, immunotherapy refers to methods of enhancing a T cell response against a tumor or cancer. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agents targets an immune checkpoint molecule. Certain tumors are able to evade the immune system by co-opting an immune checkpoint pathway. Thus, targeting immune checkpoints has emerged as an effective approach for countering a tumor's ability to evade the immune system and activating anti-tumor immunity against certain cancers. Pardoll, Nature Reviews Cancer, 2012, 12:252-264. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is an inhibitory molecule that reduces a signal involved in the T cell response to antigen. For example, CTLA4 is expressed on T cells and plays a role in downregulating T cell activation by binding to CD80 (aka B7.1) or CD86 (aka B7.2) on antigen presenting cells. PD-1 is another inhibitory checkpoint molecule that is expressed on T cells. PD-1 limits the activity of T cells in peripheral tissues during an inflammatory response.

Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an antagonist of an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is PD-1. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is PD-L1. In certain embodiments, the antagonist of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is an antibody (e.g., a monoclonal antibody). In certain embodiments, the antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody. In certain embodiments, the monoclonal antibody is a combination of an anti-CTLA4 antibody and an anti-PD-1 antibody, an anti-CTLA4 antibody and an anti-PD-L1 antibody, or an anti-PD-L1 antibody and an anti-PD-1 antibody. In certain embodiments, the anti-PD-1 antibody is one or more of pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) or nivolumab (Opdivo®). In certain embodiments, the anti-CTLA4 antibody is ipilimumab (Yervoy®). In certain embodiments, the anti-PD-L1 antibody is one or more of atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), avelumab (Bavencio®), or durvalumab (Imfinzi®). In certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an antagonist (e.g. antibody) against CD80, CD86, LAG3, KIR, TIM3, GAL9, or A2aR. In other embodiments, the antagonist is a soluble version of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, such as a soluble fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and an Fc domain of an antibody.

When a T cell binds to antigen through its T cell receptor, CD28 binds to CD80 (aka B7.1) or CD86 (aka B7.2) on antigen-presenting cells to amplify T cell receptor signaling and promote T cell activation. Because CD28 binds to the same ligands (CD80 and CD86) as CTLA4, CTLA4 is able to counteract or regulate the co-stimulatory signaling mediated by CD28. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a co-stimulatory molecule selected from CD28, inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), CD137, OX40, or CD27. In other embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a ligand of a co-stimulatory molecule, including, for example, CD80, CD86, B7RP1, B7-H3, B7-H4, CD137L, OX40L, or CD70. Agonists that target these co-stimulatory checkpoint molecules can be used to enhance antigen-specific T cell responses against certain cancers. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an agonist of a co-stimulatory checkpoint molecule. In certain embodiments, the agonist of the co-stimulatory checkpoint molecule is an agonist antibody and preferably is a monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, the agonist antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-CD28 antibody. In other embodiments, the agonist antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-ICOS, anti-CD137, anti-OX40, or anti-CD27 antibody.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,308 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textchange in circulating tumor (ctDNA) load between an early on treatment sample (usually 2-9 weeks post treatment start) and pre-treatment baseline has been shown to predict patient response and outcomes across solid tumors and therapy types in many retrospective studies. There is no consensus, however, regarding the best method for assessing molecular response. Therefore, we aimed to assess several molecular response calculations and determine the optimal method for predicting outcomes in individual advanced cancer patients. 2. Method Aggregate results of >4,000 patient sample pairs (3-10 weeks apart), >1000 patient sample technical replicates, >100 contrived sample dilutions, and in silico simulations were analyzed using cfDNA NGS assay clinical platform (Guardant Health, Inc., Redwood City, Calif., USA). Baseline and on-treatment paired patient samples were collected from advanced cancer patients with over 12 tumor types, including lung, colon, and breast. MR calculations included variant allele fractions (VAFs) of somatic SNVs, indels and fusions. Methods were compared, including Ratio of Maximum VAF (RmaxVAF), Ratio of Mean VAF (RmVAF), and Mean of VAF Ratios (mVAF). Analytical accuracy, reproducibility and limit of detection (LoD) were assessed. 3. Results Comparison of methods for calculating net change in ctDNA load on >1500 sample pairs showed high correlation (p ranged from 0.93 to 0.98) and categorical agreement split by the median (93%). Therefore selecting an optimal method based on outcome prediction would require prohibitively large patient cohorts. Analytical evaluation and in silico simulations can predict the behavior of each method. Simulations of changes in tumor fraction of real pre-treatment samples found that RmVAF or RmaxVAF are more accurate than mVAFR, which can be skewed by low VAF ratios. Almost 25% of sample pairs have a tumor driver or resistance mutation that is not the maxVAF, suggesting tumor dynamics are better captured by mVAF than maxVAF. Newly-detected on-treatment variants can be an important signal of rising ctDNA levels, impacting MR in approximately 2% of sample pairs. Importantly, MR accuracy for all methods decreases as maxVAF approaches or falls below the variant LoD, due to both stochastic detection and higher CV of variants at low VAF. Thus the assay variant LoD is a key determinant of the fraction of patients who can receive MR evaluation. Technical replicates identified the variant criteria at which a 50% change in tumor fraction differs significantly from technical variation, and could define analytical reporting limits. 4. Conclusions Comparison of MR methods in a large set of patient samples and simulations supports RmVAF with inclusion of newly-detected mutations. B. Example 2 1.

No. 15/746,395, filed Jan. 19, 2018, which is a National Phase Entry of PCT/US2016/043430, filed Jul. 21, 2016, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/195,280, filed Jul. 21, 2015, all of which are entirely incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Gene fusion events are chromosomal rearrangements that bring together formerly separate portions of at least two genes in a genome. Gene fusion events can result in cancer fusion genes, where the aberrant juxtaposition of two or more genes can encode a fusion protein, or the regulatory elements of one gene can drive the aberrant expression of an oncogene. Detecting such cancer fusion genes can be difficult. Breakpoint fragments are less likely to hybridize to probes to the same extent as fragments that do not contain breakpoints. Therefore, hybridization methods for enrichment of breakpoint fragments can lack efficacy. Fusion genes are a form of somatic mutation found in cancer cells. The ability to detect such fusion genes is useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. Fusion genes known to be found in cancer include, for example, the following: APIP/SLC1A2 in colon cancer, ATG7/RAF1 in pancreatic cancer, BCL6/RAF1 in astrocytoma, BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia, BRD4-NUT in midline carcinomas, CEP85L/ROS1 in angiosarcoma, CLTC/VMP1 in breast cancer, ELM4-ALK in lung cancer, EWSR1/CREM in in melanoma, FAM133B/CDK6 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, KIAA1549-BRAF (at 7q34) in low-grade astrocytoma, MECT1-MAML2 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, PAX8-PPARG in follicular thyroid carcinoma, RET-NTRK1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma, SEC16A-NOTCH1 in breast cancers, SRGAP3—RAF1 (at 3p25) in low-grade astrocytoma, TFE3-TFEB in kidney cancer. Breakpoints can occur at many different locations in a gene involved in gene fusion. Such breakpoint may be clustered at certain parts of the gene. One method of detecting gene fusions is by FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). Another is by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,316 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textresidues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence specific manner according to base complementarity. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure, three or more strands forming a multi stranded complex, a single self-hybridizing strand, or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process, such as the initiation of PCR, or the enzymatic cleavage of a polynucleotide by an endonuclease. A second sequence that is complementary to a first sequence is referred to as the “complement” of the first sequence. The term “hybridizable” as applied to a polynucleotide refers to the ability of the polynucleotide to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues in a hybridization reaction. “Specifically hybridize to” or “hybridizing specifically to” or “specific hybridization” refers to the formation of a stable duplex between two polynucleotides under conditions of 50% formamide, 5×SSC and 1% SDS incubated at 42° C. or 5×SSC and 1% SDS incubated at 65° C., with a wash in 0.2×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65° C. The term “stringent hybridization conditions” refers to conditions under which a polynucleotide will hybridize preferentially to its target subsequence, and to a lesser extent to, or not at all to, other sequences. “Stringent hybridization” in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology—Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes part I chapter 2 “Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays”, Elsevier, New York. Generally, highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions are selected to be about 5° C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a particular probe. Stringent hybridization conditions include a buffer comprising water, a buffer (a phosphate, tris, SSPE or SSC buffer at pH 6-9 or pH 7-8), a salt (sodium or potassium), and a denaturant (SDS, formamide or tween) and a temperature of 37° C.-70° C., 60° C.-65° C. An example of stringent hybridization conditions for hybridization of complementary nucleic acids which have more than 100 complementary residues on a filter in a Southern or northern blot is 50% formalin with 1 mg of heparin at 42° C., with the hybridization being carried out overnight. An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.15 M NaCl at 72° C. for about 15 minutes.

Often, a high stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. An example medium stringency wash for a duplex of, more than 100 nucleotides, is 1×SSC at 45° C. for 15 minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e. g., more than 100 nucleotides, is 4-6×SSC at 40° C. for 15 minutes. In general, a signal to noise ratio of 2× (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific hybridization. II. Overview Provided herein are compositions and methods for detecting polynucleotides comprising one or more fusion genes. The polynucleotides can be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The compositions and methods provided herein can detect fusion genes with high sensitivity in heterogeneous polynucleotide samples, such as cell-free DNA (“cfDNA”). DNA from cells, including cancer cells, can be shed into the blood in the form of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA has an average length of about 160 nucleotides. Because fragmentation does not occur at pre-specified points, for any genomic locus, fragments may be found in a sample that tile across that locus. In cancer, certain genes are commonly involved in gene fusions with other genes. For example, the EML4 and ALK genes commonly undergo gene fusion with each other in cancer. The breakpoint of each gene involved in a fusion can occur at breakpoint regions (“hot spots”) in each of the genes. When cells containing these fusion genes die, their DNA is shed into the blood in the form of cfDNA. As shown in  FIG.  1 Certain DNA sequencing methods use sequence capture to enrich for sequences of interest. Sequence capture typically involves the use of oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the sequence of interest. The probe set strategy can involve tiling the probes across a region of interest. Such probes can be, about 120 bases long. The set can have a depth of about 2×. The effectiveness of sequence capture depends, in part, on the length of the sequence in the target molecule that is complementary (or nearly complementary) to the sequence of the probe. However, in the case of fusion genes, polynucleotides mapping to the breakpoint may contain a sequence from the target gene that is shorter than optimal for hybridization and capture. For example, a cfDNA fragment mapping to a fusion involving an ALK-EML4 fusion may have, for example, a 150 nucleotide sequence of the ALK gene, a 100 nucleotide sequence, a 50 nucleotide sequence, a 25 nucleotide sequence or a 10 nucleotide sequence. In this case, there is a lower probability of capturing the polynucleotide if it has a shorter ALK sequence than of capturing a polynucleotide with a sequence fully complementary to the ALK probe. The problem is more acute when sequence capture is multiplex, targeting sequences from many different genes. Provided herein are, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,316 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmaterials and methods for capturing polynucleotide fragments mapping to a breakpoint in a fusion gene. Such polynucleotides are captured using high affinity polynucleotide probes, such locked nucleic acids. Such probes have higher melting temperature than probes of the same sequence made from natural nucleotides. Consequently, they produce higher yield of captured products from the same sample. Such probes can be included in a probe set targeting both fusion genes and non-fused genes. In this way, captured polynucleotides are enriched for those including fusion genes, compared with a population captured using only probes made from natural nucleotides. An exemplary probe set can contain, for example, a subset of LNA probes. The LNA probes can be configured to tile across breakpoint regions of genes involved in fusion genes. Every nucleotide in an LNA probe can be an LNA nucleotide. Alternatively, a fraction of the nucleotides can be LNA nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the LNA nucleotides can be spaced a predetermined number of nucleotides apart. The present invention provides high-affinity polynucleotides that can be used to enrich a sample containing nucleic acid fragments for those nucleic acid fragments that contain gene fusion events. These high-affinity polynucleotides can contain LNA nucleotides. Substituting LNA nucleotides for standard nucleotides can increase the melting temperature of the high-affinity polynucleotide, thereby increasing the stability of the duplex between the high-affinity polynucleotide and a nucleic acid fragment that contains a fusion gene. Gene fusions can be associated with, and in some cases contribute to, the development of a healthy cell into a neoplasm (a tumor or an adenoma). Detecting these gene fusion events may provide a useful approach for detecting and/or monitoring the presence of a neoplasm in a patient. Breakpoint fragments, however, will have less sequence derived from either gene flanking the breakpoint than a nucleic acid fragment of a similar length comprising sequence from just one of the genes. For this reason, a breakpoint fragment is often only capable of binding to a reduced section of a gene probe or gene-specific oligonucleotide. If the hybridization and wash conditions have been optimized for full-length or near full-length binding, the nucleic acid fragment containing the breakpoint can hybridize with insufficient affinity and be lost (see  FIG.  1 Tumor-derived nucleic acid can be found in cell-free bodily fluids. Tumor-derived nucleic acids from such cell-free bodily fluids can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing fusion genes in order to detect neoplasms.

Subject Types Samples are collected from subjects, e.g. patients at risk for developing cancer. The subjects may be patients with no known risk factors for cancer. The subjects can be patients whose only risk factors for cancer are age and/or gender. In some cases, the subjects can have known risk factors for cancer, e.g. smoking or familial history of cancer. In some cases, the subjects can be patients with symptoms of cancer. Other subjects can be patients with neoplasms that have previously been detected, by colonoscopy or imaging. The samples derived from patients with previously detected neoplasms can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing breakpoints in order to recommend a course of treatment or therapy. The samples derived from patients with neoplasms can be assayed for nucleic acids fragments containing breakpoints in order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment or therapy they are receiving. Other subjects can be patients with neoplasms that have been previously detected, but in whom the neoplasm is no longer detectable (patients in remission or who have no evidence of disease). The samples derived from patients in whom the neoplasm is no longer detectable can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing breakpoints in order to detect a relapse or reemergence of the neoplasm. Other subjects can be women with a familial history of cancer, wherein the genetic defect responsible for the familial cancer is known or suspected to be a fusion gene. In some cases, a woman with a family history of cancer may be pregnant and want to determine whether the fetus she is carrying has the fusion gene. In some cases, a sample containing fetal nucleic acids from such a subject can be assayed for the gene fusion event. B. Sample Types Samples can be nucleic acids extracted from various sources. Nucleic acids can be, but are not limited to, genomic DNA, RNA, mitochondrial DNA, fetal DNA, and miRNA. Samples may be extracted from a variety of bodily fluids containing cell-free nucleic acids, including but not limited to blood, serum, plasma, vitreous, sputum, urine, tears, perspiration, saliva, semen, mucosal excretions, mucus, spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, lymph fluid and the like. The collection of bodily fluids can be achieved using a variety of techniques. In some cases, collection may comprise aspiration of a bodily fluid from a subject using a syringe. In other cases collection may comprise pipetting or direct collection of fluid into a collecting vessel. After collection of bodily fluid, cell-free nucleic acids may be isolated and extracted using a variety of techniques. In some cases, cell-free nucleic acids may be isolated, extracted and prepared using commercially available kits such as the Qiagen Qiamp® Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit protocol.

Cell-free nucleic acids may be fetal in origin (via fluid taken from a pregnant subject), or may be derived from tissue of the subject itself. Cell-free nucleic acids can be derived from a neoplasm (e.g. a tumor or an adenoma). Generally, cell-free nucleic acids are extracted and isolated from bodily fluids through a partitioning step in which cell-free nucleic acids, as found in solution, are separated from cells and other non-soluble components of the bodily fluid. Partitioning may include, but is not limited to, techniques such as centrifugation or filtration. In other cases, cells are not partitioned from cell-free nucleic acids first, but rather lysed. In one example, the genomic DNA of intact cells is partitioned through selective precipitation. Cell-free nucleic acids, including DNA, may remain soluble and may be separated from insoluble genomic DNA and extracted. Generally, after addition of buffers and other wash steps specific to different kits, nucleic acids may be precipitated using isopropanol precipitation. Further clean up steps may be used such as silica based columns to remove contaminants or salts. General steps may be optimized for specific applications. Non-specific bulk carrier nucleic acids, for example, may be added throughout the reaction to optimize certain aspects of the procedure such as yield.

Isolation and purification of cell-free and tissue-derived nucleic acids may be accomplished using various approaches, including, but not limited to, the use of commercial kits and protocols provided by companies such as Sigma Aldrich, Life Technologies, Promega, Affymetrix, IBI or the like. Kits and protocols may also be non-commercially available. IV. Genetic Analysis Genetic analysis includes detection of nucleotide sequence variants, copy number variations, and fusion genes. Genetic variants can be determined by sequencing. The sequencing method can be massively parallel sequencing, that is, simultaneously (or in rapid succession) sequencing any of at least 100,000, 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion polynucleotide molecules. Sequencing methods may include, but are not limited to:, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Sequencing can be made more efficient by performing sequence capture, that is, the enrichment of a sample for target sequences of interest, sequences of cancer fusion genes and cancer fusion gene breakpoints as described herein. Sequence capture can be performed using immobilized probes that hybridize to the targets of interest. Sequence capture can be performed using probes attached to functional groups, biotin, that allow probes hybridized to specific sequences to be enriched for from a sample by pulldown. In some cases, prior to hybridization to functionalized probes, specific sequences such as adapter sequences from library fragments can be masked by annealing complementary, non-functionalized polynucleotide sequences to the fragments in order to reduce non-specific or off-target binding. In some cases the cell-free nucleic acid fragments or tissue-derived nucleic acid fragments are inputs to produce sequencing libraries. In some cases, the fragments are enriched for specific sequence prior to preparing a sequencing library. The enriched fragmented nucleic acids can be attached to any sequencing adaptor suitable for use on any sequencing platform disclosed herein. For example, a sequence adaptor can comprise a flow cell sequence, a sample barcode, or both. In another example, a sequence adaptor can be a hairpin shaped adaptor and/or comprise a sample barcode. Further, the resulting fragments can be amplified and sequenced. In some cases, the adaptor does not comprise a sequencing primer region. In some cases, the sequencing libraries are enriched for specific sequences prior to sequencing. Cell-free nucleic acids can include small amounts of tumor nucleic acids mixed with germline nucleic acids. In some cases, tumor biopsies can include small amounts of tumor tissue mixed in with healthy tissue, and nucleic acids extracted from such samples without enrichment can include small amounts of tumor nucleic acids mixed with germline nucleic acids. Sequencing methods that increase sensitivity and specificity of detecting tumor nucleic acids, and, in particular, genetic sequence variants and copy number variation, can be useful in the methods of this invention. Such methods are described in, for example, in WO 2014/039556, WO 2014/149134 and WO 2015/100427, each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference. These methods not only can detect molecules with a sensitivity of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,317 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textup to or greater than 0.1%, but also can distinguish these signals from noise typical in current sequencing methods. Increases in sensitivity and specificity from blood-based samples of cell-free nucleic acids can be achieved using various methods. One method includes high efficiency tagging of nucleic acid molecules in the sample, tagging at least any of 50%, 75% or 90% of the polynucleotides in a sample. This increases the likelihood that a low-abundance target molecule in a sample will be tagged and subsequently sequenced, and significantly increases sensitivity of detection of target molecules. Another method involves molecular tracking, which identifies sequence reads that have been redundantly generated from an original parent molecule, and assigns the most likely identity of a base at each locus or position in the parent molecule. This significantly increases specificity of detection by reducing noise generated by amplification and sequencing errors, which reduces frequency of false positives. Methods of the present disclosure can be used to detect genetic variation in non-uniquely tagged initial starting genetic material (rare nucleic acids) at a concentration that is less than 5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.01%, at a specificity of at least 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or 99.99999%. Sequence reads of tagged polynucleotides can be subsequently tracked to generate consensus sequences for polynucleotides with an error rate of no more than 2%, 1%, 0.1%, or 0.01%. V. Gene Fusion Events and Breakpoint Regions Gene fusion events are chromosomal rearrangements (inversion, deletion, and translocation) that bring together formerly separate portions of at least two different genes in a genome, resulting in a fusion gene. Fusion genes can be associated with and/or cause the formation of a neoplasm. A fusion gene can be a cancer fusion gene. A cancer fusion gene can be a fusion gene resulting from a somatic mutation that is present in a cancer. Non-limiting examples of pairs of genes that may form cancer fusion genes are found in  FIGS.  2 2 FIG.  3 FIG.  8 FIG.  8 FIG.  8 Typically, a fusion gene can result in an aberrant juxtaposition of two genes that can encode a fusion protein (BCR-ABL1), or the regulatory elements of one gene may drive the aberrant expression of an oncogene (TMPRSS2-ERG). Despite the recurrent nature of cancer fusion genes, the exact location of the breakpoint for each fusion gene can vary. A breakpoint region refers to a region of a gene that may be involved in gene fusions at which a breakpoint can occur. In some cases, the breakpoint region is at most within 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint. In some cases, the breakpoint region is within at most 200 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 750 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 1 kilobase (kb) of a breakpoint, within at most 5 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 10 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 20 kb, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In particular, in some cases high affinity polynucleotides can be between about 20 and about 200 nucleotides in length. Furthermore, in some cases high affinity polynucleotides can be between about 80 and about 160 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, high affinity polynucleotides of this invention have a sequence of at least 10, least 25, least 50, least 100 or at least 150 nucleotides perfectly complementary or substantially complementary to a target sequence of a fusion gene. High affinity polynucleotides can contain one or more LNA nucleotides. In some cases, 100% of the nucleotides within the high affinity polynucleotide are LNA nucleotides. In some cases, at least 90%, at least 70%, at least 50%, at least 20%, at least 10%, at least 5%, or at least 1% of the nucleotides within the high, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In some cases, at most 90%, at most 70%, at most 50%, at most 20%, at most 10%, at most 5%, or at most 1% of the nucleotides within the high affinity polynucleotide are LNA nucleotides. If a high affinity polynucleotide contains more than one LNA nucleotide, in some cases the LNA nucleotides can be spaced no more than 30 nucleotides apart, no more than 20 nucleotides apart, no more than 15 nucleotides apart, no more than 10 nucleotides apart, or no more than 5 nucleotides apart. In other cases where the high affinity polynucleotide contains more than one LNA nucleotide, the LNA nucleotides can be spaced at least 30 nucleotides apart, at least 20 nucleotides apart, at least 15 nucleotides apart, at least 10 nucleotides apart, or at least 5 nucleotides apart. For each LNA nucleotide inserted in place of a natural nucleotide in a high affinity polynucleotide, the melting temperature of the duplex of the high affinity polynucleotide and its complementary sequence comprising only natural nucleotides can increase at least 1° C., at least 2° C., at least 3° C., 4 at least ° C., at least 5° C., at least 6° C., at least 7° C., at least 8° C., at least 9° C., or at least 10° C. under stringent conditions. In particular, for each LNA nucleotide inserted in place of a natural nucleotide, the melting temperature can increase by between about 2° C. and about 8° C. In some cases, the melting temperature of a high affinity polynucleotide (comprising one or more LNA nucleotides) can be at least 0.5% higher, at least 1% higher, at least 2% higher, at least 3% higher, at least 4% higher, at least 5% higher, at least 10% higher, at least 15% higher, at least 20% higher, at least 25% higher, at least 30% higher, at least 35% higher, at least 40% higher, at least 45% higher, at least 50% higher, at least 55% higher, at least 60% higher, at least 65% higher, at least 70% higher, at least 75% higher, at least 80% higher, at least 85% higher, at least 90% higher, at least 95% higher, or at least 100% higher than the melting temperature of a polynucleotide comprising only natural nucleotides with the same sequence as the high affinity polynucleotide. In one configuration, bound probes may be affinity purified using a combination of binding partners. In one example, probes may contain a binding partner such as biotin. The binding partner may then be used as bait for an additional binding partner, such as streptavidin, in an affinity purification step. In some cases, bound probes may be affinity purified from unbound probes. In other cases, sample polynucleotide strands, comprising a binding partner and bound probes may be affinity purified from unbound probes. Generally, any chemical approach for capture of the bound probes may be suitable. In some cases, capture may be achieved through methods comprising biotin and streptavidin, or streptavidin derivatives.

In some cases, Beads can be useful for isolation in that molecules of interest can be attached to the beads, and the beads can be washed to remove solution components not attached to the beads, allowing for enrichment, purification and/or isolation. The beads can be separated from other components in the solution based on properties such as size, density, or dielectric, ionic, and magnetic properties. In preferred embodiments, the particles are magnetically attractable. Magnetically attractable particles can be introduced, mixed, removed, and released into solution using magnetic fields. Processes utilizing magnetically attractable particles can also be automated. Magnetically attractable particles are supplied by a number of vendors including NEB, Dynal, Micromod, Turbobeads, and Spherotech. The particles can be functionalized using functionalization chemistry to provide a surface having the binding groups required for binding to polynucleotides. In some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide are configured to hybridize to a cancer fusion gene. For example, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a portion of either gene that the fusion gene is derived from. In some cases, the cancer fusion gene can be one or more genes selected from the lists present in  FIGS.  2 2 In some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be configured to hybridize to a breakpoint region. For example, in some cases the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a portion of a breakpoint region (the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a sequence within 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint). Furthermore, in some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be configured to hybridize across a breakpoint in a fusion gene (see  FIG.  6 FIG.  6 VII.

For example, in some cases coverage depth can be at least 0.5×, wherein a set of probes or polynucleotides targets on average half of the bases in a region (see  FIG.  5 In some cases, coverage depth can be at least 1×, wherein probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that each base in a region is on average targeted by only one probes and/or polynucleotide sequence. In some cases, coverage depth can be at least 2×, wherein probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that each base in a region is on average targeted by two probes and/or polynucleotide sequences. In some cases, coverage depth by a set of probes or polynucleotides can be at least 3×, at least 4×, or at least 5×. In some cases, probes and/or polynucleotides can be tiling, wherein a set of probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that a contiguous target region is covered by the probes and/or polynucleotide sequences (see  FIG.  5 In some cases, it may be preferable to use a standard affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides to enrich for some nucleic acid fragments of interest, and to use a high affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides to enrich for other nucleic acid fragments in the same sample. For example, in some cases a standard affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides can target exomes, oncogenes, or tumor suppressor genes, and a high affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides can target fusion genes, such as cancer fusion genes (e.g. the genes listed in  FIG.  3 FIG.  6 FIG.  6 FIG.  6 FIG.  6 In some cases, a set of probes and/or polynucleotides is configured to target more than one gene in order to enrich for a panel of genes that may be involved in gene fusions (see, e.g.,  FIG.  7 In some cases, sets of probes and/or polynucleotides are configured to target a specific fusion gene. For example, the probes and/or polynucleotides can be designed to target one or both genes involved in the gene fusion. In some cases, a set of probes and/or polynucleotides comprises probes and/or polynucleotides that target a single gene and/or its breakpoints or breakpoint regions. In some cases, the standard affinity probes and/or polynucleotides are mixed with the high affinity probes and/or polynucleotides. In some cases, the standard affinity probes and/or polynucleotides and the high affinity probes and/or polynucleotides are separate and employed sequentially. Furthermore, in some cases the sample is first contacted with the standard affinity probes, and then the uncaptured nucleic acid fragments are contacted with the high affinity probes. In some cases, high affinity probe sets can include standard affinity polynucleotides doped with high affinity polynucleotides. In such a probe set, a target sequence can be targeted for hybridization by both standard and high affinity polynucleotides. In such a doped set, the high affinity polynucleotides can target only sequences at a breakpoint region. VIII. Kits The present, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The kits can comprise any of the probes and/or polynucleotides disclosed herein. In some cases, the kit can comprise a plurality of probe sets, wherein each probe set hybridizes to a different gene and at least one of the probe sets is configured to hybridize to a fusion gene and comprises one or more high affinity polynucleotides and/or probes. IX. Methods of Use The present disclosure provides methods for enriching for breakpoint fragments using any of the probes and/or polynucleotides disclosed herein. Such methods can comprise contacting a probe set that hybridizes to a fusion gene, wherein one or more probes and/or polynucleotides is a high affinity polynucleotide and/or probe, with a mixture of polynucleotides to produce probe-captured polynucleotides. The probe-captured polynucleotides can then be isolated to produce a sample enriched for polynucleotides comprising breakpoint fragments of the fusion gene. In some cases, the polynucleotides are cell-free DNA. In some cases, the polynucleotides are fragmented genomic DNA. In some cases, the probe-captured polynucleotides are eluted to isolate the captured polynucleotides form the probes. In some cases, the eluted polynucleotides are directly sequenced or used to produce sequencing libraries. Methods of detecting fusion genes are provided. In a method, at least one probe set comprising at least one high affinity polynucleotide is provided that is directed to a gene involved in a gene fusion. The probe set can include both standard affinity and high affinity polynucleotide probes. In some embodiments, the probe set comprises a plurality of probe subsets, each subset directed to sequences of a different gene of interest, one or more of which genes are involved in a gene fusion in cancer and, in some examples, at least of which genes is not involved in a gene fusion. The probe set may be mixed with a sample comprising DNA, such as cfDNA, under stringent hybridization conditions, and the DNA may be allowed to hybridize to the probes. Because the probe set includes high affinity polynucleotide probes, the probability of capturing DNA fragments including a fusion gene break point is increased. Captured DNA may be isolated from the probe and sequenced. Sequences may be analyzed to detect DNA fragments having sequences that span a breakpoint, such as DNA fragments that include sequences from two different genes normally not fused. The presence of fusion genes may be correlated with a disease, such as cancer. Accordingly, this method is useful in the diagnosis of the disease, such as cancer.

Thus, there is a need for improved methods, systems and apparatus for analyzing methylation status of DNA and identifying methylation biomarkers. In particular, there is a need for methods for use in diagnosis and/or classification of colorectal neoplasms. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides for, among other things, various systems, methods, and apparatus for identifying biomarkers for detection of a disease or condition. A disease or condition discussed herein can be, e.g., advanced adenoma, colorectal cancer, other cancers, or other diseases or conditions associated with an aberrant methylation status (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and the like). In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for detecting colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma that include analysis of one or more methylation biomarkers in cfDNA (e.g., ctDNA) of a subject. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma detection that includes determining the methylation status of one or more methylation biomarkers in DNA e.g., cfDNA using a next generation sequencing (NGS) technique (e.g., a targeted NGS technique, a hybrid-capture based NGS technique). Various methods provided herein are useful in colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma screening by analysis of an accessible tissue sample of a subject, e.g., a tissue sample that is blood or a blood component (e.g., cfDNA, e.g., ctDNA). In certain embodiments, methods described herein are blood based tests with significantly higher overall sensitivity for advanced adenoma detection. In certain embodiments, the sensitivity of an advanced adenoma test is at least 54% or greater. In certain embodiments, the methods described herein use blood-based markers from DNA (e.g., cell free DNA). In certain embodiments, methods described herein detect advance adenoma in a human subject. In certain embodiments, a method comprises: determining a methylation status of at least a portion of each of the DMRs of Table 15, Table 16, Table 17 and/or  FIGS.  3 3 FIGS.  3 3 In certain embodiments each of the DMRs of Table 15, Table 16, Table 17 and/or  FIGS.  3 3 In various embodiments, the methods described herein include screening for mutations of one or more mutation markers in cfDNA e.g., ctDNA. Mutations identified through detection methods described herein may be used to further classify and/or diagnose a disease or condition in combination with the methylation status(es) of the methylation biomarkers. For example, the presence of mutations in mutation markers and methylation status(es) of methylation markers may be acquired (e.g., simultaneously) in the same assay (e.g., a NGS assay) conducted on a single sample. Obtaining information corresponding to methylation and, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,322 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmutation markers in the same assay allows for decreased costs and increased efficiency by not having to conduct separate assays. Additionally or alternatively, mutation markers may allow for further classification of a disease or condition (e.g., cancer). The presence and/or absence of one or more mutations may also allow for identification or recommendation of therapies for treatment of the disease and/or condition. In various embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods and/or systems for identifying methylation status of a methylation biomarker in cfDNA of a subject (e.g., a human subject) and/or detecting (e.g., screening for) a disease and/or condition (e.g., cancer) based on the methylation status of one or more known biomarkers. In certain embodiments, read-wise methylation values obtained from reads of methylation biomarkers are used to identify or diagnose a disease, e.g., using a classification model. In certain embodiments, a read-wise methylation value for a methylation biomarker may be based on a comparison a number of methylated reads of a control DNA sample not affected by the disease and/or condition (e.g., cfDNA from a “healthy” subject, buffy coat DNA, DNA from a “healthy” tissue) as compared to a number of methylated reads of a pathological DNA sample affected by the disease or condition (e.g., cfDNA, e.g., ctDNA). In various embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods and/or systems to obtain read-wise methylation values of one or more target biomarkers (e.g., DMRs) using NGS sequencing data. While it is understood that methylation status of individual markers may change in DNA of a subject afflicted by a disease, current bioinformatics-based tools used to identify abnormal methylation are insufficient to accurately detect abnormal methylation patterns. For example, current tools are not sufficiently sensitive to changes in methylation states between control and disease states to detect significant methylation changes in methylation markers. Additionally, such tools suffer from high signal to noise ratio, particularly when using cfDNA as a sample source as, in certain diseases, the amount of cfDNA in a sample may be small in blood or plasma samples. A read-wise assessment of methylation allows for a more appropriate identification and assessment of methylation. In various embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods and/or systems for conducting next-generation sequencing (NGS) on samples of DNA, e.g., cfDNA. NGS sequencing on DNA samples is typically conducted using standard sets of manufactured kits and techniques. However, standard NGS techniques may insufficiently cover target regions, particularly as GC content of regions may vary widely from region to region. For example, methylation markers may have high GC content while mutation markers may have low GC content. Under certain NGS sequencing conditions, variations in GC content may lead to over-representation of regions having high GC, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,322 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textcontent and/or underrepresentation of low GC content regions. Steps taken to improve GC coverage of high GC content regions may, in turn, lower coverage of low GC content regions (or vice versa). In addition, current NGS sequencing techniques lack sufficient means for determining data quality of samples. In certain embodiments, methods and systems disclosed herein may improve NGS sequencing data quality. In certain embodiments, coverage of low GC content regions may be improved by altering probe design and/or experimental parameters related to DNA sample processing. For example, sequencing of a mutation marker with low CG content may be improved by increasing probe tiling density and/or overlapping probes over the low GC content region. In certain embodiments, GC dropout rate is used as a quality control value to assess NGS sequencing coverage. GC dropout rate is indicative of coverage of high GC content target regions (e.g., regions having greater than 50% GC content, e.g., greater than 60% GC content, greater than 70% GC content). In certain embodiments, sequencing data having a low GC dropout rate (e.g., 6% or less, 5% or less, 4% or less, 3% or less) are desirable. In certain embodiments, conversion rates of DNA is used to quantitatively assess NGS data quality. For example, conversion of a control sequence of DNA (e.g., a spike-in control) may be used to assess conversion (e.g., bisulfite or enzymatic conversion) rates of unmethylated and/or methylated cytosines to uracil. A high conversion efficiency of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is desirable when, for example, bisulfite or enzymatically treating DNA. Unconverted cytosines are typically identified as being methylated when reviewing data of sequenced, converted DNA. In certain embodiments, low conversion rates of methylated cytosines to uracil is desirable. In certain embodiments, parameters related to DNA conversion are changed to enhance or alter conversion rates. For example, increasing a ratio of bisulfite reagent to DNA may be used to alter conversion rates. In certain embodiments, altering a thermocycler step including a number of cycles (e.g., a number of denaturation and conversion steps), time of a step in a cycle, temperature of a cycle, or combination thereof may be adjusted to affect a conversion rate. In various aspects, methods and compositions of the present invention can be used in combination with biomarkers known in the art, e.g., as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,006,925 and U.S. Patent No. 63/011,970, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In one aspect, the invention is directed to a method of detecting advanced adenoma in a human subject, the method comprising: determining a methylation status of each of two or more markers identified in DNA from a sample obtained from the subject, and determining whether the subject has advanced adenoma based at least in part on the determined methylation status of each of the two or more markers, wherein, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Detection of Methylation in Colorectal Neoplasias Using a UDX Colon Test Advanced adenomas (AA) are precursors of colorectal cancer (CRC) with around 85% of the sporadic cancers originating from them. In certain embodiments, AAs are defined by the presence of four polyp features including a diameter of >1.0 cm, villous architecture, serrated adenoma with dysplasia and/or high-grade dysplasia. Of these, high-grade dysplasia is generally believed to be the most highly associated with progression to cancer, making its detection and removal important for prevention of colorectal cancer. Several screening options such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

However, their adenoma detection rates remain low at 24% and 42% respectively (Imperiale T F, et al. N Engl J Med 370; 14, 2014). Furthermore, FIT and Cologuard require stool handling and frequent testing, which results in low adherence rates to the screening program. Only around 65% of the eligible patients take part of the screening, leaving large proportion of eligible patients unscreened. A simple, noninvasive blood-based CRC screening test with high sensitivity would increase screening adherence rates as well as improve the AA detection rates, which would substantially improve CRC control efforts. Blood based screenings are believed to have >90% adherence rates at baseline. In certain embodiments, methods, systems, and techniques described herein are used to conduct a UDX Colon test. The UDX Colon test is qualitative next generation sequencing (NGS)-based in vitro diagnostic that uses high throughput, targeted hybridization-based capture with bioinformatics processes to detect methylation in more than 300 colorectal neoplasia (e.g., colorectal cancer, advanced adenoma) associated methylation loci in DNA, e.g., cfDNA of a human subject. In certain embodiments, a UDX Colon test utilizes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma of whole blood in order to identify methylated loci. A positive result may indicate a presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) or advanced adenoma (AA). A positive result may be followed by diagnostic colonoscopy or other diagnosis-confirmatory assay. A UDX Colon test may be used to detect (e.g., screen) for a colorectal neoplasia in adults 45 years or older, who are at an average risk for CRC. In certain embodiments, a UDX Colon Test includes reagents, software, procedures, or a combination thereof, for testing cfDNA from whole blood samples.

In various instances, a predetermined number of nucleotides upstream and/or downstream and be or include, e.g., 500 bp, 1 kb, 2 kb, 3 kb, 4 kb, 5 kb, 10 kb, 20 kb, 30 kb, 40 kb, 50 kb, 75 kb, or 100 kb. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that methylation biomarkers capable of impacting expression of a coding sequence may typically be within any of these distances of the coding sequence, upstream and/or downstream. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that a methylation locus identified as a methylation biomarker need not necessarily be assayed in a single experiment, reaction, or amplicon. A single methylation locus identified as a colorectal cancer methylation biomarker can be assayed, e.g., in a method including separate amplification (or providing oligonucleotide primers and conditions sufficient for amplification of) of one or more distinct or overlapping DNA regions within a methylation locus, e.g., one or more distinct or overlapping DMRs. Those of skill in the art will further appreciate that a methylation locus identified as a methylation biomarker need not be analyzed for methylation status of each nucleotide, nor each CpG, present within the methylation locus. Rather, a methylation locus that is a methylation biomarker may be analyzed, e.g., by analysis of a single DNA region within the methylation locus, e.g., by analysis of a single DMR within the methylation locus. DMRs of the present disclosure can be a methylation locus or include a portion of a methylation locus. In some instances, a DMR is a DNA region with a methylation locus that is, e.g., 1 to 5,000 bp in length.

Moreover, a methylation biomarker can include two or more methylation loci. Accordingly, status as a methylation biomarker does not turn on the contiguousness of nucleic acids included in a biomarker, but rather on the existence of a change in methylation status for included DNA region(s) between a first state and a second state, such as between colorectal cancer and controls, advanced adenoma and controls, or both colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma and controls.

For example, in certain embodiments, the group of reference samples is a plurality of samples obtained from individuals where said samples are known to represent a particular state (e.g., a “normal” non-cancer state, or a cancer state). In certain instances, a reference is a non-contemporaneous sample from the same source, e.g., a prior sample from the same source, e.g., from the same subject. In certain instances, a reference for the methylation status of one or more methylation loci (e.g., one or more DMRs) is the methylation status of the one or more methylation loci (e.g., one or more DMRs) in a sample (e.g., a sample from a subject), or a plurality of samples, known to represent a particular state (e.g., a cancer state or a non-cancer state). Thus, a reference can be or include one or more predetermined thresholds, which thresholds can be quantitative (e.g., a methylation value) or qualitative.

In various embodiments, a methylation status of a methylation loci may be based on methylation of one or more reads (e.g., obtained using a NGS technique) mapped to the methylation loci. For example, when analyzing sequencing data obtained from a sequencing technique, e.g., a NGS sequencing technique, e.g., a targeted NGS sequencing technique, sequencing data may include an inferred or probabilistic sequence of base pairs of a DNA fragment. The inferred or probabilistic sequence of base pairs of the DNA fragment is known as a read. The read may be mapped to a methylation loci (e.g., a DMR, a mutation marker) reference sequence, for example, in a genome (e.g., a reference genome, e.g., a reference bisulfite converted genome). Based on a comparison of the read sequence to a reference sequence, individual CpGs or cytosine residues may be identified as being hypermethylated or hypomethylated as compared to a reference state. In certain embodiments, a read-wise methylation value (e.g., a read-wise methylation score) is determined for a read, based pre-determined minimal thresholds that takes into account a number of methylation sites (e.g., CpGs) and a percentage of methylation In certain embodiments, a read-wise methylation value is a binary value.

A sample from a subject, e.g., a human or other mammalian subject, can be a sample of, e.g., blood, blood component (e.g., plasma, buffy coat), cfDNA (cell free DNA), ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA), stool, or tissue (e.g., advanced adenoma and/or colorectal tissue). In some particular embodiments, a sample is an excretion or bodily fluid of a subject (e.g., stool, blood, plasma, lymph, or urine of a subject) or a tissue sample of a colorectal neoplasm, such as a colonic polyp, an advanced adenoma, and/or colorectal cancer. A sample from a subject can be a cell or tissue sample, e.g., a cell or tissue sample that is of a cancer or includes cancer cells, e.g., of a tumor or of a metastatic tissue. For example, the sample may include colorectal cells, polyp cells, or glandular cells. In various embodiments, a sample from a subject, e.g., a human or other mammalian subject, can be obtained by biopsy (e.g., colonoscopy resection, fine needle aspiration or tissue biopsy) or surgery. In various particular embodiments, a sample is a sample of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA is typically found in biological fluids (e.g., plasma, serum, or urine) in short, double-stranded fragments. The concentration of cfDNA is typically low, but can significantly increase under particular conditions, including without limitation pregnancy, autoimmune disorder, myocardial infraction, and cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the component of circulating DNA specifically derived from cancer cells. ctDNA can be present in human fluids. For example in some instances, ctDNA can be found bound to and/or associated with leukocytes and erythrocytes. In some instances, ctDNA can be found not bound to and/or associated with leukocytes and erythrocytes. Various tests for detection of tumor-derived cfDNA are based on detection of genetic or epigenetic, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,342 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmodifications that are characteristic of cancer (e.g., of a relevant cancer). Genetic or epigenetic modifications characteristic of cancer can include, without limitation, oncogenic or cancer-associated mutations in tumor-suppressor genes, activated oncogenes, hypermethylation, and/or chromosomal disorders. Detection of genetic or epigenetic modifications characteristic of cancer or pre-cancer can confirm that detected cfDNA is ctDNA. cfDNA and ctDNA provide a real-time or nearly real-time metric of the methylation status of a source tissue. cfDNA and ctDNA have a half-life in blood of about 2 hours, such that a sample taken at a given time provides a relatively timely reflection of the status of a source tissue. Various methods of isolating nucleic acids from a sample (e.g., of isolating cfDNA from blood or plasma) are known in the art. Nucleic acids can be isolated, e.g., without limitation, standard DNA purification techniques, by direct gene capture (e.g., by clarification of a sample to remove assay-inhibiting agents and capturing a target nucleic acid, if present, from the clarified sample with a capture agent to produce a capture complex, and isolating the capture complex to recover the target nucleic acid). In certain embodiments, a sample may have a required minimum amount of DNA (e.g., cfDNA, gDNA) (e.g., DNA fragments) for later determining a methylation status. For example, in certain embodiments, a sample may be required to have at least 5 ng, at least 10 ng, at least 20 ng (or more) DNA. Methods of Measuring Methylation Status Methylation status can be measured by a variety of methods known in the art and/or by methods provided in this specification. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that a method for measuring methylation status can generally be applied to samples from any source and of any kind, and will further be aware of processing steps available to modify a sample into a form suitable for measurement by a given methodology. In certain embodiments, the processing steps involve fragmenting or shearing DNA of the sample. For example, genomic DNA (e.g., gDNA) obtained from a cell, tissue, or other source may require fragmentation prior to sequencing. In certain embodiments, DNA may be fragmented prior to measurement of methylation status using a physical method (e.g., using an ultra-sonicator, a nebulizer technique, hydrodynamic shearing, etc.). In certain embodiments, DNA may be fragmented using an enzymatic method (e.g., using an endonuclease or a transposase). Certain samples, e.g., cfDNA samples, may not require fragmentation. cfDNA fragments are about 200 bp in length and may be appropriate for certain methods provided herein. DNA fragments of about 100-1000 bp in length are suitable for analysis in certain NGS techniques described herein including, for example, Illumina® based techniques. Certain technologies may require DNA fragments of about 100-1000 bp range. In contrast, DNA fragments of about 10 kb or longer, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,343 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textare suitable for long read sequencing technologies. Methods of measuring methylation status include, without limitation, methods including whole genome bisulfite sequencing, targeted bisulfite sequencing, targeted enzymatic methylation sequencing, methylation-status-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), methods including mass spectrometry, methylation arrays, methods including methylation-specific nucleases, methods including mass-based separation, methods including target-specific capture (e.g., hybrid capture), and methods including methylation-specific oligonucleotide primers. Certain particular assays for methylation utilize a bisulfite reagent (e.g., hydrogen sulfite ions) or enzymatic conversion reagents (e.g., Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase  2 Bisulfite reagents can include, among other things, bisulfite, disulfite, hydrogen sulfite, sodium metabisulphite, or combinations thereof, which reagents can be useful in distinguishing methylated and unmethylated nucleic acids. Bisulfite interacts differently with cytosine and 5-methylcytosine. In typical bisulfite-based methods, contacting of DNA (e.g., single stranded DNA, double stranded DNA) with bisulfite deaminates (e.g., converts) unmethylated cytosine to uracil, while methylated cytosine remains unaffected. Methylated cytosines, but not unmethylated cytosines, are selectively retained. Thus, in a bisulfite processed sample, uracil residues stand in place of, and thus provide an identifying signal for, unmethylated cytosine residues, while remaining (methylated) cytosine residues thus provide an identifying signal for methylated cytosine residues. Bisulfite processed samples can be analyzed, e.g., by next generation sequencing (NGS) or other methods disclosed herein. In some embodiments, bisulfite processed samples may be treated using a bisulfite ratio of bisulfite to DNA that is at least. In certain embodiments, the bisulfite processed sample comprises single stranded DNA fragments or double stranded DNA fragments. In some embodiments, bisulfite treatment includes subjecting DNA fragments (e.g., double stranded DNA) to one or more denaturation-conversion cycles in order to convert unmethylation cytosines to uracils in the DNA fragments. Denaturation converts double stranded DNA fragments in the sample to single stranded DNA fragments. Conversion changes the unmethylated cytosines of the single stranded DNA into uracils. In some embodiments, only one denaturation-conversion cycle are performed. In some embodiments, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, fifteen, twenty, or more denaturation-conversion cycles are performed. In some embodiments, the temperature of the denaturation step is performed at a temperature of about 80-100° C. (e.g., about 90-97° C., e.g., about 96° C.). In some embodiments, the denaturation step is performed for less than 10 minutes (e.g., less than 5 minutes, less than 5 minutes, less than 2 minutes, or less).

In certain embodiments, the conversion step is performed at a temperature of 55 to 65° C. In certain embodiments, the converted DNA fragments may be stored at a temperature of about 4° C. after performing the denaturation-conversion cycle(s). In some embodiments, bisulfite treatment may be applied prior to library preparation. In some embodiments, bisfulfite treatment may be applied after library preparation. Enzymatic conversion reagents can include Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase  2 Methods of measuring methylation status can include, without limitation, massively parallel sequencing (e.g., next-generation sequencing) to determine methylation state, e.g., sequencing by—synthesis, real-time (e.g., single-molecule) sequencing, bead emulsion sequencing, nanopore sequencing, or other sequencing techniques known in the art. In some embodiments, a method of measuring methylation status can include whole-genome sequencing, e.g., measuring whole genome methylation status from bisulfite or enzymatically treated material with base-pair resolution. In some embodiments, a method of measuring methylation status includes reduced representation bisulfite sequencing e.g., utilizing use of restriction enzymes to measure methylation status of high CpG content regions from bisulfite or enzymatically treated material with base-pair resolution. In some embodiments, a method of measuring methylation status can include targeted sequencing e.g., measuring methylation status of pre-selected genomic location from bisulfite or enzymatically treated material with base-pair resolution. In some embodiments, the pre-selection (capture) (e.g., enrichment) of regions of interest (e.g., DMRs) can be done by complementary in vitro synthesized oligonucleotide sequences (e.g., capture baits/probes). Capture probes (e.g., oligonucleotide capture probes, oligonucleotide capture baits) are useful in targeted sequencing (e.g., NGS) techniques to enrich for particular regions of interest in an oligonucleotide (e.g., DNA) sequence. For example, enrichment of target regions is useful when sequences of particular pre-determined regions of DNA are sequenced. In certain embodiments, capture probes are about 10 to 1000 bp long (e.g., about 10 to about 200 bp long) (e.g., about 120 bp long). In certain embodiments, one or more capture probes are targeted to capture a region of interest (e.g., a genomic marker) corresponding to one or more methylation loci (e.g., methylation loci comprising at least a portion of one or more DMRs, e.g., as found in  FIG.  2 FIGS.  3 3 In certain embodiments, capture probes are evaluated (e.g., prior to sequencing) for their ability to target multiple regions of the genome of interest. For example, when designing a capture probe to target a particular region of interest (e.g., a DMR), the ability for a capture probe to, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,343 - WARNING - An error occurred: input texttarget multiple regions of the genome may be considered. As discussed herein, mismatches in pairing (e.g., non-Watson-Crick pairing) allow for capture probes to hybridize to other, unintended regions of a genome. In addition, a particular target sequence may be repeated elsewhere in a genome. Repeat sequences are common for sequences that are highly repetitive. In certain embodiments, capture probes are designed such that they only target a few similar regions of the genome. In certain embodiments, capture probes may hybridize to 500 or fewer, 100 or fewer, 50 or fewer, 10 or fewer, 5 or fewer similar regions in a genome. In certain embodiments, a similar region to the target of region of interest is calculated using a 24 bp window moving around a genome and matching the region of the window to a reference sequence according to sequence order similarity. Other size windows and/or techniques may be used. For example, hybrid-capture of one or more DNA fragments (e.g., ctDNA, fragmented gDNA) may be performed using capture probes targeted to predetermined regions of interested of a genome. In certain embodiments, capture probes target at least 2 (e.g, at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, or more) predetermined regions of interest (e.g., genomic markers, e.g., DMRs). In certain embodiments, the capture probes overlap. In certain embodiments, the overlapping probes overlap at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60% or more. In certain embodiments, the capture probes are nucleic acid probes (e.g., DNA probes, RNA probes). In some embodiments, a method may also include identifying mutated regions (e.g., individual nucleotide bases) using targeted sequencing e.g., determining the presence of a mutation in one or more pre-selected genomic locations (e.g., a genomic marker, e.g., a mutation marker). In certain embodiments, mutations may also be identified from bisulfite or enzymatically treated DNA with base-pair resolution. In some embodiments, a method for measuring methylation status can include Illumina Methylation Assays e.g., measuring over 850,000 methylation sites quantitatively across a genome at single-nucleotide resolution. Various methylation assay procedures can be used in conjunction with bisulfite treatment to determine methylation status of a target sequence such as a DMR. Such assays can include, among others, Methylation-Specific Restriction Enzyme qPCR, sequencing of bisulfite-treated nucleic acid, PCR (e.g., with sequence-specific amplification), Methylation Specific Nuclease-assisted Minor-allele Enrichment PCR, and Methylation-Sensitive High Resolution Melting. In some embodiments, DMRs are amplified from converted (e.g., bisulfite or enzyme converted) DNA fragments for library preparation. In some embodiments, a sequencing library may be prepared using converted (e.g., bisulfite or enzyme converted) oligonucleotide, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,349 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmethods of determining methylation status). MS-HRM is an in-tube, PCR-based method to detect methylation levels at specific loci of interest based on hybridization melting. Bisulfite treatment of the DNA prior to performing MS-HRM ensures a different base composition between methylated and unmethylated DNA, which is used to separate the resulting amplicons by high resolution melting. A unique primer design facilitates a high sensitivity of the assays enabling detection of down to 0.1-1% methylated alleles in an unmethylated background. Oligonucleotide primers for MS-HRM assays are designed to be complementary to the methylated allele, and a specific annealing temperature enables these primers to anneal both to the methylated and the unmethylated alleles thereby increasing the sensitivity of the assays. Another method that can be used to determine methylation status after bisulfite treatment of a sample is Quantitative Multiplex Methylation-Specific PCR (QM-MSP). QM-MSP uses methylation specific primers for sensitive quantification of DNA methylation (see, e.g., Fackler 2018 Methods Mol Biol. 1708:473-496, which is herein incorporated by reference with respect to methods of determining methylation status). QM-MSP is a two-step PCR approach, where in the first step, one pair of gene-specific primers (forward and reverse) amplifies the methylated and unmethylated copies of the same gene simultaneously and in multiplex, in one PCR reaction. This methylation-independent amplification step produces amplicons of up to 10 9  Another method that can be used to determine methylation status after bisulfite treatment of a sample is Methylation Specific Nuclease-assisted Minor-allele Enrichment (MS-NaME) (see, e.g., Liu 2017 Nucleic Acids Res. 45(6):e39, which is herein incorporated by reference with respect to methods of determining methylation status). Ms-NaME is based on selective hybridization of probes to target sequences in the presence of DNA nuclease specific to double-stranded (ds) DNA (DSN), such that hybridization results in regions of double-stranded DNA that are subsequently digested by the DSN. Thus, oligonucleotide probes targeting unmethylated sequences generate local double stranded regions resulting to digestion of unmethylated targets; oligonucleotide probes capable of hybridizing to methylated sequences generate local double-stranded regions that result in digestion of methylated targets, leaving methylated targets intact. Moreover, oligonucleotide probes can direct DSN activity to multiple targets in bisulfite-treated DNA, simultaneously. Subsequent amplification can enrich non-digested sequences. Ms-NaME can be used, either independently or in combination with other techniques provided herein. Another method that can be used to determine methylation status after bisulfite treatment of a sample is Methylation-sensitive Single Nucleotide Primer Extension (Ms-SNuPE™) (see, e.g., Gonzalgo 2007 Nat Protoc. 2(8):1931-6, which is herein, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,349 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textincorporated by reference with respect to methods of determining methylation status). In Ms-SNuPE, strand-specific PCR is performed to generate a DNA template for quantitative methylation analysis using Ms-SNuPE. SNuPE is then performed with oligonucleotide(s) designed to hybridize immediately upstream of the CpG site(s) being interrogated. Reaction products can be electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels for visualization and quantitation by phosphor-image analysis. Amplicons can also carry a directly or indirectly detectable labels such as a fluorescent label, radionuclide, or a detachable molecule fragment or other entity having a mass that can be distinguished by mass spectrometry. Detection may be carried out and/or visualized by means of, e.g., matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) or using electron spray mass spectrometry (ESI). Certain methods that can be used to determine methylation status after bisulfite treatment of a sample utilize a first oligonucleotide primer, a second oligonucleotide primer, and an oligonucleotide probe in an amplification-based method. For instance, the oligonucleotide primers and probe can be used in a method of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In various instances, the first oligonucleotide primer, the second oligonucleotide primer, and/or the oligonucleotide probe selectively hybridize methylated DNA and/or unmethylated DNA, such that amplification or probe signal indicate methylation status of a sample. Other bisulfite-based methods for detecting methylation status (e.g., the presence of level of 5-methylcytosine) are disclosed, e.g., in Frommer (1992 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1; 89(5):1827-31, which is herein incorporated by reference with respect to methods of determining methylation status). In certain MSRE-qPCR embodiments, the amount of total DNA is measured in an aliquot of sample in native (e.g., undigested) form using, e.g., real-time PCR or digital PCR. Various amplification technologies can be used alone or in conjunction with other techniques described herein for detection of methylation status. Those of skill in the art, having reviewed the present specification, will understand how to combine various amplification technologies known in the art and/or described herein together with various other technologies for methylation status determination known in the art and/or provided herein. Amplification technologies include, without limitation, PCR, e.g., quantitative PCR (qPCR), real-time PCR, and/or digital PCR. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that polymerase amplification can multiplex amplification of multiple targets in a single reaction. PCR amplicons are typically 100 to 2000 base pairs in length. In various instances, an amplification technology is sufficient to determine methylations status. Digital PCR (dPCR) based methods involve dividing and distributing a sample across wells of a plate with 96-, 384-, or more, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,349 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textwells, or in individual emulsion droplets (ddPCR) e.g., using a microfluidic device, such that some wells include one or more copies of template and others include no copies of template. Thus, the average number of template molecules per well is less than one prior to amplification. The number of wells in which amplification of template occurs provides a measure of template concentration. If the sample has been contacted with MSRE, the number of wells in which amplification of template occurs provides a measure of the concentration of methylated template. In various embodiments a fluorescence-based real-time PCR assay, such as MethyLight™, can be used to measure methylation status (see, e.g., Campan 2018 Methods Mol Biol. 1708:497-513, which is herein incorporated by reference with respect to methods of determining methylation status). MethyLight is a quantitative, fluorescence-based, real-time PCR method to sensitively detect and quantify DNA methylation of candidate regions of the genome. MethyLight is uniquely suited for detecting low-frequency methylated DNA regions against a high background of unmethylated DNA, as it combines methylation-specific priming with methylation-specific fluorescent probing. Additionally, MethyLight can be combined with Digital PCR, for the highly sensitive detection of individual methylated molecules, with use in disease detection and screening. Real-time PCR-based methods for use in determining methylation status typically include a step of generating a standard curve for unmethylated DNA based on analysis of external standards. A standard curve can be constructed from at least two points and can permit comparison of a real-time Ct value for digested DNA and/or a real-time Ct value for undigested DNA to known quantitative standards. In particular instances, sample Ct values can be determined for MSRE-digested and/or undigested samples or sample aliquots, and the genomic equivalents of DNA can be calculated from the standard curve. Ct values of MSRE-digested and undigested DNA can be evaluated to identify amplicons digested (e.g., efficiently digested; e.g., yielding a Ct value of 45). Amplicons not amplified under either digested or undigested conditions can also be identified. Corrected Ct values for amplicons of interest can then be directly compared across conditions to establish relative differences in methylation status between conditions. Alternatively or additionally, delta-difference between the Ct values of digested and undigested DNA can be used to establish relative differences in methylation status between conditions. In certain particular embodiments, targeted bisulfite sequencing (e.g., using hybrid capture) among other techniques, can be used to determine the methylation status of a methylation biomarker for a disease and/or condition. For example, a colorectal neoplasm (e.g., advanced adenoma and/or colorectal cancer) methylation biomarker that is or includes a single methylation locus.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that in embodiments in which a plurality of methylation loci (e.g., a plurality of DMRs) are analyzed for methylation status in a method of screening for colorectal cancer provided herein, methylation status of each methylation locus can be measured or represented in any of a variety of forms, and the methylation statuses of a plurality of methylation loci (preferably each measured and/or represented in a same, similar, or comparable manner) be together or cumulatively analyzed or represented in any of a variety of forms. In various embodiments, methylation status of each methylation locus can be measured as methylation portion. In various embodiments, methylation status of each methylation locus can be represented as the percentage value of methylated reads from total sequencing reads compared against reference sample. In various embodiments, methylation status of each methylation locus can be represented as a qualitative comparison to a reference, e.g., by identification of each methylation locus as hypermethylated or hypomethylated. In some embodiments in which a single methylation locus is analyzed, hypermethylation of the single methylation locus constitutes a diagnosis that a subject is suffering from or possibly suffering from a condition (e.g., cancer) (e.g., advanced adenoma, colorectal cancer), while absence of hypermethylation of the single methylation locus constitutes a diagnosis that the subject is likely not suffering from a condition. In some embodiments, hypermethylation of a single methylation locus (e.g., a single DMR) of a plurality of analyzed methylation loci constitutes a diagnosis that a subject is suffering from or possibly suffering from the condition, while the absence of hypermethylation at any methylation locus of a plurality of analyzed methylation loci constitutes a diagnosis that a subject is likely not suffering from the condition. In some embodiments, hypermethylation of a determined percentage (e.g., a predetermined percentage) of methylation loci (e.g., at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or 100%)) of a plurality of analyzed methylation loci constitutes a diagnosis that a subject is suffering from or possibly suffering from the condition, while the absence of hypermethylation of a determined percentage (e.g., a predetermined percentage) of methylation loci (e.g., at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or 100%)) of a plurality of analyzed methylation loci constitutes a diagnosis that a subject is not likely suffering from the condition.

In some embodiments, methylation status of a plurality of methylation loci (e.g., a plurality of DMRs) is measured qualitatively or quantitatively and the measurement for each of the plurality of methylation loci are combined to provide a diagnosis. In some embodiments, the quantitatively measured methylation status of each of a plurality of methylation loci is individually weighted, and weighted values are combined to provide a single value that can be comparative to a reference in order to provide a diagnosis. In some embodiments, methylation status may include determination of methylated and/or unmethylated reads mapped to a genomic region (e.g., a DMR). For example, when using particular sequencing technologies as disclosed herein (e.g., NGS, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, etc.), sequence reads are produced. A sequence read is an inferred sequence of base pairs (e.g., a probabilistic sequence) corresponding to all or part of a sequenced oligonucleotide (e.g., DNA) fragment (e.g., cfDNA fragments, gDNA fragments). In certain embodiments, sequence reads may be mapped (e.g., aligned) to a particular region of interest using a reference sequence (e.g., a bisulfite converted reference sequence) in order to determine if there are any alterations or variations in a read. Alterations may include methylation and/or mutations. A region of interest may include one or more genomic markers including a methylation marker (e.g., a DMR), a mutation marker, or other marker as disclosed herein. For example, in the case of bisulfite or enzymatically treated DNA fragments, treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils, while methylated cytosines are not converted to uracils. Accordingly, a sequence read produced for a DNA fragment that has methylated cytosines will be different from a sequence read produced for the same DNA fragment that does not have methylated cytosine.

Quality control steps are used to determine whether or not particular steps or processes were conducted within particular parameters. In certain embodiments, quality control steps may be used to determine the validity of results of a given analysis. In addition or alternatively, quality control steps may be used to determine sequenced data quality. For example, quality control steps may be used to determine read coverage of one or more regions of DNA. Quantitative metrics for quality control include, but are not limited to AT dropout rate, GC dropout rate, bisulfite conversion rate (e.g., bisulfite conversion efficiency), and the like. Failure to meet a threshold quality control condition (e.g., a minimum conversion rate, a maximum CG dropout rate, etc.) may indicate, for example, that one or more of the conversion steps were not performed within appropriate parameters. For example, in the methods described herein, various steps of a conversion protocol may be optimized to decrease AT and/or GC dropout rate. As is understood by those of skill in the art, AT and GC dropout metrics indicate the degree of inadequate coverage of a particular target region based on its AT or GC content. In certain embodiments, samples having a low GC dropout rate is useful in identifying which samples were processed appropriately. For example, a GC dropout rate found to be less than 10%, less than 9%, less than 8%, less than 7%, less than 6%, less than 5%, less than 4%, or less may be useful in identifying appropriately processed samples. In certain embodiments, a quality control step may involve determining an on and/or off-target ratio. Sequence reads that align to a region of interest (e.g., a DMR) are considered to be on-target, while sequence reads that do not align to the region of interest (e.g., a DMR) are considered to be off-target. In certain embodiments, the on-target ratio is represented as a percentage of on-target bases to the total number of aligned bases. In certain embodiments, the on-target ratio is represented as a percentage of on-target and near-target bases to the total number of aligned bases. Near-target bases may be a base within a certain number of bases (e.g., within 500 bp, within 200 bp, within 100 bp) of the target region. In certain embodiments, the on-target ratio is at least 10%, least 20%, least 30%, least 40%, least 50%, least 60%, least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or more for a sequencing experiment to pass quality control.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,350 - WARNING - An error occurred: input text1% for a sequencing experiment to pass quality control. In certain embodiments, a quality control step may include determining quality scores for mapped sequence reads. A quality score is a value which quantifies a probability that a sequence read is incorrectly mapped. For example, when mapping short or repetitive sequences, it is possible that a sequence will be mapped to multiple places in a reference genome. The quality score considers the best alignment of the sequence read to the reference genome as compared to other possible alignments of the sequence read to the reference genome. In certain embodiments, the quality score is a Mapping Quality (MAPQ) score. The MAPQ is the negative, log-scaled probability that a read is misaligned. A high score indicates a high confidence that a read is aligned correctly, while a low score indicates a low confidence that a read is aligned correctly. In certain embodiments, the MAPQ score may be calculated using the following equation:, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,350 - WARNING - An error occurred: input text10  Pr In certain embodiments, the MAPQ score is rounded to the nearest integer. In certain embodiments Pr is a probability that the sequence read is incorrectly mapped as obtained from an alignment (e.g., mapping) tool. In certain embodiments, the scaling factor is 1 (instead of 10), or another number. Artificial Spike-In Control Control nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) molecules (e.g., “spike-in controls”) may be used to evaluate or estimate conversion efficiency of unmethylated and methylated cytosines to uracils. Control nucleic acid molecules may be used in sequencing methods involving conversion (e.g., bisulfite or enzymatic conversion) of DNA samples. When DNA is subjected to conversion (e.g., bisulfite or enzymatic conversion) as described herein, conversion may be incomplete. That is, some number of unmethylated cytosines may not be converted to uracils. If the conversion is not complete such that unmethylated cytosines are not mostly converted, the unconverted unmethylated cytosines may be identified as methylated when the DNA sequenced. Accordingly, in order to determine whether or not bisulfite conversion is complete, a control DNA molecule may be subjected to conversion along with DNA fragments from a sample. In certain embodiments, sequencing the converted control DNA molecules (e.g., using an NGS technique as described herein) generates a plurality of control sequence reads. Control sequence reads may be used to determine conversion rates of unmethylated and/or methylated cytosines to uracils. Prior techniques did not recognize that controls (e.g., a control DNA molecule) were useful to include in each sample. Rather, they presumed that conversion efficiencies remained relatively consistent between samples for a given run. However, the inventors have identified that conversion rate of unmethylated cytosines to uracils in DNA fragments may vary significantly from on sample to another. For example, conversion efficiency may range from 10% to 110% within a single batch of processed samples. Note, there can be overconversion such that conversion efficiency can be greater than 100%, e.g., the conversion efficiency is 110% when 10% of the methylated cytosine gets converted. In certain embodiments, the conversion efficiency ranges from 30% to 110%. In other embodiments, the conversion efficiency ranges from 50% to 100%. In certain embodiments, a control DNA molecule may be added to a sample after fragmentation and before conversion using e.g., bisulfite or enzymatic reagents. In certain embodiments, a plurality (e.g., two, three, four or more) control DNA sequences may be added to DNA fragments of a sample. A control DNA molecule may be a known sequence. For example, the sequence, number of methylated bases, and number of unmethylated bases of the control sequence had been determined prior to addition of the control DNA molecule to the sample. In certain embodiments, a control sequence may be a DNA sequence which is produced in vitro to contain, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,350 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textartificially methylated or unmethylated nucleotides (e.g., methylated cytosines). In certain embodiments, a control sequence may be a DNA sequence which is produced to contain completely unmethylated DNA nucleotides. A high conversion efficiency of the spike-in control sequence may be used to infer the conversion efficiency of a DNA fragments undergoing the same conversion process as a spike-in control. For example, deamination of at least at least 98% of unmethylated cytosines in the unmethylated spike-in control DNA sequence indicates that conversion efficiency is high and that a sample may pass a quality control assessment. In certain embodiments, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% of unmethylated cytosines of a plurality of DNA fragments of a control DNA sequence are converted into uracils. A high conversion efficiency is important as it is ideal for all (or nearly all) of the unmethylated cytosines to be converted to uracils when subjecting DNA to bisulfite or enzymatic treatments. As described above, unconverted, unmethylated cytosines may serve as a source of noise in the data. In addition, conversion of methylated cytosines to uracils is undesirable when DNA is treated using a conversion process. Conversion of methylated cytosines of a spike-in control is indicative that methylated cytosines have been converted to uracils in a DNA sample subjected to the same treatment as the methylated spike-in control. Methylated cytosines in a methylated spike-in control should not convert to uracils. For the same reasons as described above, methylated cytosines being converted to uracils may result in misidentification of purportedly unmethylated cytosines during methylation analysis. In certain embodiments, at most 5%, at most 4%, at most 3%, at most 2% or at most 1% of methylated cytosines of a plurality of DNA fragments of a control DNA sequence are converted into uracils. For example, deamination of at most 2% of methylated cytosines in a methylated spike-in control DNA sequence indicates that conversion efficiency is high and that a sample may pass a quality control assessment. Identifying Mutations In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, genomic mutations may be identified in one or more predetermined mutation biomarkers. In various embodiments, a mutation biomarker of the present disclosure is used for further detection (e.g., screening) and/or classification of a condition in addition to methylation biomarkers. In certain embodiments, information regarding a methylation status of one or more colorectal cancer biomarkers may be combined with a mutation biomarker in order to further classify the identified colorectal cancer. In addition or alternatively, mutation biomarkers may be used to determine or recommend (e.g., either for or against) a particular course of treatment for the identified disease and/or condition. In certain embodiments, identifying genomic mutations may be performed using, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides (e.g., cfDNA fragments, gDNA fragments) are sequenced to a read depth sufficient to detect a genomic mutation (e.g., in a mutation biomarker, in a tumor markers) at a frequency in a sample as low as 1.0%, 0.75%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%, 0.075%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.01%, or 0.005%. Genomic mutations generally include any variation in nucleotide base pair sequences of DNA as is understood in the art. A mutation in a nucleic acid may, in some embodiments, include a single nucleotide variant, an inversion, a deletion, an insertion, a transversion, a translocation, a fusion, a truncation, an amplification, or a combination thereof, as compared to a reference DNA sequence. FIG.  4 FIG.  4 FIG.  4 By way of example, NRAS_p.A146, listed in the first row of  FIG.  4 FIG.  4 Mutations may be identified using NGS sequencing techniques (e.g., targeted NGS sequencing techniques, hybridization NGS sequencing techniques, or the like) or other sequencing techniques disclosed herein. In certain embodiments as disclosed herein, mutations may be identified in converted (e.g., bisulfite or enzymatic converted) DNA fragments. In certain embodiments, mutations and methylated loci may be identified in parallel (e.g., simultaneously) using a single sequencing assay (e.g., an NGS assay). In certain embodiments, one or more capture probes are targeted to capture and/or enrich for a region of interest of an oligonucleotide (e.g., DNA) sequence corresponding to one or more mutations markers (e.g., mutation regions and sites as found in  FIG.  4 In certain embodiments, mutation markers contain low GC content regions. Due to the low GC content, sufficient coverage of a region may not be obtained when sequencing a low GC content region using protocols adapted for high GC content regions. For example, targeted NGS sequencing (e.g., targeted bisulfite sequencing) of a low GC content region using only 1× tiling density of a target region may not provide sufficient coverage of a mutation region. Tiling (e.g., tiling density, tiling frequency) refers to a number of probes targeted to a region. Increased probe tiling density (e.g., through increasing the number of probes targeting a region) may be used in order to provide additional coverage for a region. For example, coverage of a low GC content region may be improved through increased tiling. Accordingly, increasing tiling density of a region to at least 2× tiling (e.g., 3×, 4× or more) may be beneficial in enhancing enrichment of a targeted region. For example, with 2× tiling, a region covered by a probe may be covered with at two probes which overlap with one another. In addition or alternatively, probes may be overlapped to permit enhanced coverage of a region. For example, probes may be overlapped by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more. The amount which two probes overlap with one another may depend on desired, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

For the avoidance of doubt, tiling and/or overlap of probes may also be changed over high GC content regions (e.g., methylation loci) as well. Exemplary Deduplication Steps In certain embodiments as discussed herein, duplicate sequences are found in sequencing data. Duplicate sequences arise from a number of potential sources as discussed herein, and accordingly may need to be removed from sequencing data. Duplicates are particularly important to remove in an analysis as signals from cancer are low. Cancer signals would get lost in noise if duplicates are not removed. For example, in certain embodiments sequencing data may include a large number of reads obtained from sequencing oligonucleotide fragments (e.g., DNA fragments, e.g., cfDNA, gDNA fragments) of a sample. Multiple reads corresponding to a particular DNA fragment may result in false variant calls (e.g., identification of multiple variants of the same DNA fragment), which would interfere with the identification of a methylated CpG site and/or a mutation. In certain embodiments, duplicate sequences are removed prior to determining read-wise methylation values. In certain embodiments, a bioinformatics package (e.g., Picard, SAMTools) may be used to mark and remove duplicates from sequencing data. FIG.  13 1300 1310 1320 1330 In certain embodiments, PCR duplicates (also known as library duplicates) and/or over-sequencing duplicates may also be removed ( 1340 1350 In certain embodiments, deduplicating sequence reads does not comprise removing duplicate sequence reads that have a different methylation level. For example, a sample may have two sequence reads that are identical. However, one sequence read may have a CpG site that is methylated, while the same CpG site in the other strand is not methylated. In certain embodiments, both strands may be kept for further bioinformatics analysis. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, a presence of different methylation levels within duplicate fragments may be due to sequencing errors or a different source of one fragment. Applications Methods and compositions of the present disclosure can be used in any of a variety of applications. For example, methods and compositions of the present disclosure can be used to screen, or aid in screening for a condition (e.g., cancer). In particular, the methods and compositions can be used to screen, or aid in screening for a colorectal neoplasm, e.g., advanced adenoma and/or colorectal cancer. In various instances, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure can detect any stage of colorectal cancer, including without limitation early-stage colorectal cancer.

In some embodiments, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure is applied to individuals 18 to 40 years of age. In various embodiments, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure is applied to individuals experiencing abdominal pain or discomfort, e.g., experiencing undiagnosed or incompletely diagnosed abdominal pain or discomfort. In various embodiments, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure is applied to individuals experiencing no symptoms likely to be associated with a cancer or a colorectal neoplasm such as advanced adenoma, polyposis, and/or colorectal cancer. Thus, in certain embodiments, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure is fully or partially preventative or prophylactic, at least with respect to later or non-early stages of cancer. In various embodiments, cancer screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure can be applied to an asymptomatic human subject. In particular, a subject can be referred to as “asymptomatic” if the subject does not report, and/or demonstrate by non-invasively observable indicia (e.g., without one, several, or all of device-based probing, tissue sample analysis, bodily fluid analysis, surgery, or cancer screening), sufficient characteristics of the condition to support a medically reasonable suspicion that the subject is likely suffering from the condition. Detection of a colorectal neoplasm such as advanced adenoma and/or early stage colorectal cancer is particularly likely in asymptomatic individuals screened in accordance with methods and compositions of the present disclosure. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that regular, preventative, and/or prophylactic screening for a colorectal neoplasm such as advanced adenoma and/or colorectal cancer improves diagnosis. As noted above, early stage cancers include, according to at least one system of cancer staging, Stages 0 to II C of colorectal cancer. Thus, the present disclosure provides, among other things, methods and compositions particularly useful for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal neoplasms including advanced adenoma, polyposis and/or early stage colorectal cancer. Generally, and particularly in embodiments in which screening in accordance with the present disclosure is carried out annually, and/or in which a subject is asymptomatic at time of screening, methods and compositions of the present invention are especially likely to detect early stage colorectal cancer.

In various embodiments, colorectal cancer screening in accordance with the present disclosure is performed on a regular basis, e.g., every six months, annually, every two years, every three years, every four years, every five years, or every ten years. In various embodiments, screening using methods and compositions disclosed herein will provide a diagnosis of a condition (e.g., a type or class of a colorectal neoplasm). In other instances, screening for colorectal neoplasms using methods and compositions disclosed herein will be indicative of having one or more conditions, but not definitive for diagnosis of a particular condition. For example, screening may be used to classify a subject as having one or more conditions or combination of conditions including, but not limited to, advanced adenoma and/or colorectal cancer. In various instances, screening using methods and compositions of the present disclosure can be followed by a further diagnosis-confirmatory assay, which further assay can confirm, support, undermine, or reject a diagnosis resulting from prior screening, e.g., screening in accordance with the present disclosure. In various embodiments, screening in accordance with methods and compositions of the present disclosure reduces colorectal cancer mortality, e.g., by early colorectal cancer diagnosis. Data supports that colorectal cancer screening reduces colorectal cancer mortality, which effect persisted for over 30 years (see, e.g., Shaukat 2013 N Engl J Med. 369(12):1106-14). Moreover, colorectal cancer is particularly difficult to treat at least in part because colorectal cancer, absent timely screening, may not be detected until cancer is past early stages. For at least this reason, treatment of colorectal cancer is often unsuccessful. To maximize population-wide improvement of colorectal cancer outcomes, utilization of screening in accordance with the present disclosure can be paired with, e.g., recruitment of eligible subjects to ensure widespread screening. In various embodiments, screening of colorectal neoplasms including one or more methods and/or compositions disclosed herein is followed by treatment of colorectal cancer, e.g., treatment of early stage colorectal cancer. In various embodiments, treatment of colorectal cancer, e.g., early stage colorectal cancer, includes administration of a therapeutic regimen including one or more of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In various embodiments, treatment of colorectal cancer, e.g., early stage colorectal cancer, includes administration of a therapeutic regimen including one or more of treatments provided herein for treatment of stage 0 colorectal cancer, stage I colorectal cancer, and/or stage II colorectal cancer.

In certain embodiments, the kit may include software (e.g., for analyzing methylation status of DMRs). EXAMPLES Example 1: Identification of Markers Associated with Colorectal Cancer and Advanced Adenoma The purpose of this Example was to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in DNA of colorectal cancer and colonic adenoma samples (e.g., samples from subjects having advanced adenoma). Identification of DMRs was performed by comparing DNA of subjects having colorectal cancer and/or colonic adenomas with matching control samples. This comparison allowed for development of methods that would elucidate colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma related methylation patterns from cell-free (cfDNA). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was used to identify differences in methylation status in samples of genomic DNA (gDNA) and cfDNA obtained from a variety of sources. gDNA was obtained from tissue samples with different histological backgrounds (e.g., colorectal cancer, colonic adenoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and matching controls) and buffy coat samples. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from tissue and buffy coat samples was extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to a manufacturer's protocol. Extracted gDNA was then further processed in order to fragment it. For example, gDNA was fragmented into segments having lengths of about 400 bp with a Covaris S220 ultra-sonicator. cfDNA from plasma samples was extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted and fragmented gDNA (genomic DNA) and cfDNA was bisulfite-converted with EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning kit (ZymoResearch). Sequencing libraries were prepared from the bisulfite converted DNA fragments by using Accel-NGS Methyl-seq DNA library kit (Swift Biosciences). The converted DNA fragments were sequenced with average depth of 37.5× with NovaSeq6000 (Illumina) equipment, using paired-end sequencing. For this experiment, paired-end sequencing was conducted such that 150 bp of each end of a converted DNA fragment was covered (e.g., 2×150). The sequenced reads were aligned to a bisulfite-converted human genome (Ensembl 91 assembly) using Bisulfite Read Mapper with Bowtie 2. The following steps were used to align sequenced reads to a bisulfite-converted human genome:, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Probes were designed such that there were at least one probe per strand and one probe per methylation status. That is, there were two probes targeting the coding strand and two probes targeting the non-coding strand. One of the two probes in each pair targeted a methlyated fragment, while the other probe targeted an unmethylated fragment. For capturing partially methylated regions, a mismatch count of 8 is used for the probe and target region (e.g., up to about 8 bases may be mismatched (e.g., form non-Watson-Crick base pairings) between a DNA fragment belonging to a target region and a capture probe). In this experiment, probes for methylation targets were designed using 1× tiling density. Probes for mutation targets were designed using 3× tiling density with each base in the target being covered by at least 3 different probes (e.g., where there is substantial overlap between the probes). The mutation probes were designed using 3× tiling to assure higher capture efficiency for low CG content regions (e.g., regions having from about 30% to about 40% GC content) that otherwise would be under-represented. Tiling density refers to the coverage of the target region by probes. For example, probes designed having 1× tiling density would cover each base of the target region at least once. Probes with 3× tiling density would cover the target region at least 3×. A custom algorithm aligned candidate probes to the genome and scored the number potential of on- and off-target mapping events. Probes with >250 genomic regions globally mapping to off-target regions, were omitted from the final panel design. Biotinylated probes were synthesized and combined into a final targeted methylation panel. Off-target mapping was done also after the initial assay design and testing. Targets were omitted if they caused more than 1% off-target capture in an actual panel. Purified libraries (about 187.5 ng each) were pooled together in 8-plex, dried using concentrator plus (Eppendorf) and captured using a Fast Hybridization Target Enrichment Protocol by Twist® and a customized panel probes as described herein, which was designed to capture methylation and mutation targets of interest. Fragments bound to biotinylated probes were captured using streptavidin coated beads. The captured fragments from the purified libraries were reamplified using PCR amplification for 11 cycles following manufacturer's protocol. The amplified libraries were then purified with Twist beads. An exemplary method describing the Twist Fast Hybridization Target Enrichment protocol is presented below.

Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) was used for dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity of the further prediction model building with random forest. Sequential backwards selection learns which features (e.g., DMRs) are most informative at each step, and then chooses the next feature depending on the already selected features. SBS is a sequential process where features from the full feature subset were removed until the new feature subspace contained a set of features upon which a model did not improve. A set of 203 marker regions (listed in  FIG.  2 Advanced Adenoma Model Preliminary analysis of markers for advanced adenoma detection potential was developed similarly to the colorectal cancer model. Using a pre-selected region list and AMBER score thresholds defined on colorectal cancer tissue samples, results obtained from advanced adenoma and control samples were evaluated separately in cross-validation setting. 50-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation was used in each iteration as above. In each iteration, 50% of the samples were used as training and 50% of samples were used for testing and validation. Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) was used for dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity for prediction model building.

Using a 90% adherence rate for blood tests as opposed to 65% of the stool tests, 68 advanced adenoma patients (68/76) would take part of the blood test-based screening. In contrast, only 42 (42/76) would take part with a stool test. With 54% sensitivity, 37 patients (37/68) would be correctly identified as advanced adenoma patients using a blood based test (e.g., as described herein), as opposed to 18 patients with stool test (18/42). Accordingly, there would be a 2× increase in the actual detection rate for AA using blood-based tests described herein.

This file is labelled “SEQLIST.txt” dated May 13, 2022 and is 11,518 bytes in size. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to various compositions and methods for regulating EGFR amplification in cancer in order to sensitize tumor cells to EGFR-targeted anti-cancer agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Several publications and patent documents are cited throughout the specification in order to describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. Each of these citations is incorporated herein by reference as though set forth in full. Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer cells (1). These abnormalities can include entire chromosome events or they can be localized to site-specific chromosomal regions (2). For example, the chromosome 112-25 (112-25) region is regularly amplified in tumors (3-9). This amplification event is often associated with drug resistance as a number of genes (e.g., MCL1, CKS1B which confer drug resistance) reside within this chromosomal region (3-9). Amplification of these regions can occur as frequently as the well documented oncogene amplifications MYC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in certain tumor types (e.g., 1921.3 at 21% versus MYC at 26% in liver cancer; (10)). However, it is important to note that amplifications are not always permanently integrated (2). A recent study estimated that approximately 50% of tumors contain extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications for the EGFR and MYC genes (11). The extrachromosomal nature of these copy gains provides the cell an opportunity to either select for or against these amplifications, which will impact cell growth and drug response. For example, extrachromosomal amplification of EGFR results in increased sensitivity to targeted therapies. However, following prolonged treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, the ecDNA copies of EGFR are reduced, leading to therapy resistance (12). In the case of methotrexate therapy, the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene is amplified and provides resistance (13-16). DHFR amplifications can occur as integrated and/or extrachromosomal events (13-16). It is clear that extrachromosomal amplifications promote tumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptation, both of which are major contributors to drug resistance (2,11). Elucidating the cellular physiology and molecular mechanisms that promote oncogene-associated extrachromosomal events should have a profound impact on our understanding of tumor, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,654 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textheterogeneity and drug resistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying extrachromosomal amplification events are still poorly understood; however, recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for epigenetic states and chromatin modifying enzymes in controlling site-specific re-replication, and in turn, DNA copy number amplification (10,17-19). For example, overexpression or stabilization of the H3K9/36 tri-demethylase KDM4A, and the direct modulation of chromatin states (H3K9 and K36 methylation) promotes transient site-specific DNA copy gains (TSSGs) within the Chr1q12-21 region (17-20). These DNA copy gains are transiently generated during S phase and are lost in late S or early G2 phase of the cell cycle (18). Indeed, KDM4A interacts with components of the replication machinery, facilitating re-replication at the TSSG sites (18). EGFR DNA amplification tends to result in poor prognosis for patients with EGFR-amplified cancer (22). EGFR-targeted therapies have been developed in recent years (23) and EGFR amplifications have been shown to associate with varying degrees of patient response across various amplified tumors (24-29). EGFR DNA amplification is prevalent across a number of different cancer types, with up to 54% of patients exhibiting amplification in some tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) (10). An important clinical challenge with EGFR amplification is the plasticity of the amplification (12). Therefore, there is a major clinical need to resolve the mechanisms driving EGFR amplification in order to generate effective therapeutic strategies to treat these aggressive cancers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a method for treating a subject having an EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) resistant tumor is provided. In one aspect, the method entails determining EGFR copy number in cells obtained from said tumor, contacting the cells with an agent that modulates amplification of EGFR to a level which sensitizes said cells to EGFR inhibitors; and administering to the subject an EGFRi, thereby reducing tumor cell proliferation or inducing tumor cell killing which exceeds that observed in tumor cells not treated with the EGFR amplification modulation agent. In certain embodiments, copy number is determined using DNA FISH. In a preferred embodiment, the EGFR copy number is determined to be high and said tumor cells are contacted with at least one inhibitor selected from EZH2 inhibitor, KDM5 inhibitor and KDM5A inhibitor which further increases EGFR amplification and sensitivity of said cells to EGFRi. In certain embodiments, the inhibitor inhibits EZH2. In other embodiments, the inhibitor is tazemetostat. The cells to be treated can be diploid for EGFR copies. The cells can have an EGFR copy number of between 3-7. In other aspects, the tumor cells have a copy number of EGFR of 8 or higher. In other embodiments, the cells exhibit a loss of heterozygosity in the EGFR region and the inhibitor is an EZH2, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,654 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textinhibitor. The tumor cells can also be contacted with at least one histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT), thereby increasing EGFR copy number and rendering the tumor more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. The KMT can be selected from KMT2A, SETD1A and SETD1B. In other embodiments, the method includes administration of at least one EGFR inhibitor selected from gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, osimertinib, panitumumab, neratinib, vandetanib, necitumumab, and dacomitinib. In preferred embodiments, the at least one EGFR inhibitor is selected from gefinitnib or lapatnib. In yet another aspect, the modulation of EGFR amplification reduces tumor heterogeneity. An exemplary method for reducing tumor heterogeneity in a subject in need thereof, in order to sensitize the tumor to EGFRi therapy, comprises reducing EGFR amplification levels via administration at least one KDM4 inhibitor and treating said tumor with an EGFR inhibitor. In certain cases, the tumor cells are hypoxic. The method can further comprise determining EGFR amplification levels prior to KDM4 inhibitor administration step. In other aspects of the methods, methylase and demethylase expression levels in the tumor are determined at protein and RNA levels. The inhibitors of the invention are administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier via route selected from the group consisting of systemic, oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intracerebral, intratumoral and topical administration. Preferred routes of administration include systemic and oral administration., Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Recent studies have begun to uncover the importance of epigenetic states and histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) in regulating transient site-specific DNA copy number gains (TSSGs). We have revealed a critical interplay between a myriad of lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in modulating H3K4/9/27 methylation balance in order to control extrachromosomal amplification of the EGFR oncogene. Further, we establish that cellular signals (hypoxia and epidermal growth factor) are able to directly promote EGFR amplification through modulation of the enzymes controlling EGFR copy gains. Moreover, we demonstrate that chemical inhibitors targeting specific KMTs and KDMs are able to promote or block extrachromosomal EGFR amplification, which identifies useful therapeutic strategies for controlling EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer, and in turn, drug response. We demonstrate that chromatin modifying enzymes and their associated epigenetic states control amplification of the EGFR locus.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,654 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textwe demonstrate that directly interfering with H3K9 and H3K27 methylation promotes EGFR amplification. Furthermore, we establish a critical interplay between H3K4/9/27 lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in either promoting or blocking EGFR amplification. For example, KDM4A overexpression promotes EGFR copy gains in conjunction with three H3K4 methyltransferases: KMT2A/MLL1, SETD1A and SETD1B. In addition, we demonstrate that suppression of specific H3K9 KMTs and the H3K27 KMT EZH2 generates EGFR amplification. Consistent with these genetic experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that chemical inhibitors targeting KMT-KDMs are able to rheostat EGFR copy number, and in turn, growth factor and EGFR inhibitor responses. Lastly, we demonstrate that extrinsic cellular cues, such as hypoxia and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), promote EGFR amplification by modulating the KMT-KDM network that controls EGFR copy number. Taken together, this data uncovers both chromatin modifiers and extracellular signals that control EGFR amplification and demonstrate that epigenetic therapies could hold a key to modulating EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer, which has significant clinical implications.

As used herein, the terms “tumor”, “tumor growth” or “tumor tissue” can be used interchangeably, and refer to an abnormal growth of tissue resulting from uncontrolled progressive multiplication of cells and serving no physiological function. A solid tumor can be malignant, e.g. tending to metastasize and being life threatening, or benign. Examples of solid tumors that can be treated or prevented according to a method of the present invention include sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, liver metastases, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma such as anaplastic thyroid cancer, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma such as small cell lung carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and retinoblastoma. As used herein, the phrase “chromosomal instability” refers to a higher than normal rate of mis-segregation of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes during mitosis due to defective cell cycle quality control mechanisms, resulting in copy number alterations (CNAs) or aneuploidy. The phrase “gene amplification” or “copy number amplification” refers to an increase in the number of copies of a gene sequence. There may also be an increase in the RNA and protein made from that gene. Gene amplification is common in cancer cells, and some amplified genes may cause cancer cells to grow or become resistant to anticancer drugs. Gene amplification of oncogens on ecDNA is a frequent event in cancer. Unequal segregation of ecDNA from a parental tumor cell to offspring cells can rapidly increase tumor heterogeneity. The phrase “tumor heterogeneity” refers to differences between cancer cells in a tumor. For example, a tumor may have multiple populations characterized by different genetic variants. Tumor heterogeneity can provide the tumor with an additional array of responses to microenvironment-induced, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,661 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textand therapy-induced stress factors. These differences may explain why some tumor cells remain present in a patient after cancer treatment has finished. Reduced tumor heterogeneity leads to improved success with cancer treatments. The term “drug response” as used herein, means any biological response in an organism that is the result of exposure to the drug. Drug responses can be favorable, such as when a patient's disease is eradicated by treatment with the drug, or unfavorable, such as when a patient enters a coma upon treatment with a drug. The phrase “drug resistant tumor” refers to any tumor that retains tumor cells after cancer treatment has finished. A drug resistant tumor may be resistant to a specific treatment, e.g. treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, or may be resistant to multiple forms of treatment. A drug resistant tumor may initially have a favorable response to the drug, however some cells may remain unaffected. Epigenetic state or Epigenetic phenomena, as used herein, means changes produced in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. For example, methylation of cytosines (Cs) or histone modifications can affect expression of a gene. These molecular modifications of the DNA are often called “epigenetic marks.” For example, increased or decreased methylation of Cs in a genome are part of normal biology but can also be associated with disease. As used herein, “epigenetic state” refers to a gene or region in a genome that reflects particular epigenetic phenomena. For example, in a particular disease cohort, a gene can be found that causes disease through multiple mechanisms, including, but not limited to, impairment of protein function by a SNV, deletion of the gene via a CNV, little or no expression of the gene due to a change in the epigenetic state of the gene itself and/or regulatory region(s) in the genome controlling expression of the gene. The phrase “histone lysine methyltransferase” or “KMT” refers to a histone-modifying enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of one, two, or three methyl groups to lysine residues of histone proteins. An inhibitor of KTM is, for example, chaetocin, DANep, BIX-01294, EGCG, sinefungin, adenoine dialdehyde, and novobiocin. The phrase “histone lysine demethylase” or “KDM” refers to a histone-modifying enzyme that catalyzes the removal of methyl groups from the lysine residues of histone proteins. Methylated histones can either repress or activate transcription depending on the site of methylation. An inhibitor of KDM is, for example, tranylcyprome, phenelzine, a polyamine analogue, N-oxalyglycine (NOG), disulfuram, ebselen, and an N-oxalyl D-tyrosine derivative.

We observed increased sensitivity to both Lapatinib and Gefitinib in KDM4A overexpressing cells when compared to control cells ( FIG.  4 4 FIG.  4 4 FIG.  3 FIG.  4 FIG.  3 Since EGFR amplifications are observed in lung tumors (10,22) and cancer cell lines (i.e., HCC827; (41,42)), we tested whether KDM4A could be contributing to the observed EGFR amplifications in lung cancer cells. We used both KDM4A siRNA depletion and chemical inhibition (KDM4i (QC6352); (43)) of the KDM4 family to assess the impact of KDM4A on EGFR amplification. Specifically, we used DNA FISH to test whether the classically used EGFR amplified HCC827 lung cancer cells would have reduced amplifications upon KDM4A depletion or inhibition. HCC827 cells, in addition to exhibiting extensive EGFR amplification, have an acquired activating mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (Exon 19 deletion) (41).

Specifically, RPE cells were siRNA depleted with at least two independent siRNAs for each K9 KMT. The knockdowns were confirmed and cell cycle profiles were generated for each siRNA, which ensures no overt arrests occurred, and in turn, interfere with EGFR copy gains ( FIG.  7 7 FIG.  8 FIG.  8 EZH2 and KDM6 Enzymes Regulate EGFR Copy Number In addition to H3K9 methylation interference causing EGFR amplification, we also observed that H3K27 methylation interference increased EGFR copy number ( FIG.  1 1 FIG.  8 FIG.  1 1 FIG.  1 Using two independent siRNAs against EZH2 in RPE cells, we observed a significant increase in EGFR copy number while not changing copy number of other chr7 regions ( FIG.  8 FIG.  7 7 FIG.  8 8 FIG.  11 11 FIG.  7 7 FIG.  8 FIG.  7 FIG.  8 FIG.  1 1 FIG.  8 FIGS.  8 7 7 FIG.  8 Since EZH2 inhibition promoted EGFR amplification and increased expression levels, we tested whether cells treated with the EZH2i or EZH2 siRNA depletion would respond differently to EGF supplementation.

Upon evaluating H3K4mel/2/3 across the EGFR locus, we observed an inverse relationship between H3K4 methylation states and H3K27me3, which appears to flank the regions containing H3K4 methylation ( FIG.  8 FIG.  9 FIG.  10 10 FIG.  8 Since H3K4 methylation is key to KDM4A binding and copy gain generation at other specific sites in the genome (10,18), we also tested whether H3K4M would block KDM4A promoted EGFR copy gains. Indeed, H3K4M blocked KDM4A driven EGFR amplification ( FIG.  9 FIG.  10 10 FIG.  5 FIG.  9 9 FIG.  10 10 FIG.  4 FIG.  9 H3K4 KMTs were recently shown to be important in controlling the predilection of regions to amplify downstream of KDM4 members. For example, overexpression of each KMT2 family member promoted copy gains of specific chromosome 1 TSSG loci (10). Therefore, we overexpressed each H3K4 KMT (MLL1/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2B, MLL4/KMT2D, SETD1A and SETD1B; (47)) to determine whether all or select KMTs promote EGFR amplification ( FIG.  10 10 FIG.  9 FIG.  9 FIG.  10 10 Since specific H3K4 KMTs controlled EGFR amplification, we tested whether the same was true for the H3K4 KDMs. The KDM5 enzymes are H3K4 tri-demethylases and have been shown to impact other TSSG sites (10). Depletion of the H3K4 tri-demethylases will increase H3K4 methylation, thereby promoting copy gains of EGFR if copy gains of this locus are indeed dependent on H3K4 methylation. Therefore, we depleted each KDM5 member with at least two independent siRNAs before conducting cell cycle profiles and EGFR FISH ( FIG.  10 10 FIG.  9 FIG.  10 10 FIG.  9 FIG.  9 FIG.  9 FIG.  9 9 FIG.  9 Our studies suggest that promoting H3K4 methylation through KDM5A depletion or inhibition would promote EGFR amplification through KDM4A. First, we evaluated the impact of KDM5 inhibitor (KDM5i) treatment on EGFR amplification (KDM5i-C70; (51,52)). KDM5i treatment promoted EGFR copy gains, however, they returned to baseline upon KDM5i washout ( FIG.  9 FIG.  10 FIG.  9 9 FIG.  10 10 FIG.  9 9 Having therapeutic control of key growth factor receptors could have a profound impact on the ability to control cell proliferation and drug response when delivering inhibitors. Therefore, we tested whether KDM5i would alter cell proliferation when treated with supplemental EGF. Consistent with the previous experiments demonstrating that factors promoting EGFR copy gains increased EGF associated proliferation, KDM5i increased cell proliferation with supplemented EGF when compared to KDM5i alone ( FIG.  9 FIG.  9 FIG.  10 FIG.  9 Hypoxia and Epidermal Growth Factor Induce EGFR Amplification, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Consistent with this previous observation, 24 hours of exposure to hypoxia was able to stabilize KDM4A in RPE cells ( FIGS.  11 11 FIGS.  11 11 FIGS.  12 12 FIGS.  11 11 FIG.  11 FIG.  12 FIG.  11 FIGS.  12 12 FIG.  12 While investigating hypoxia modulation of EGFR amplification, we also tested whether EGF supplementation would impact EGFR copy gains. A recent report demonstrated that cancer cells with EGFR amplification required EGF supplementation in the media to propagate the copy gains, which raised the possibility that EGF could directly promote EGFR copy gains (54). Consistent with this possibility, we demonstrated that treating cells for 24 hours with 50 ng/ml EGF, the preferred ligand of EGFR, results in significant copy number gains of the EGFR locus ( FIG.  11 11 FIG.  11 11 FIG.  12 12 FIG.  11 FIG.  14 Given the importance of H3K4 methylation in targeting KDM4A so that TSSGs occur, we hypothesized that EGF was promoting the TSSGs via the H3K4 KMTs, and in turn, H3K4 methylation. Therefore, we first tested whether H3K4M would block EGF-induced EGFR copy gains. We observed that expression of the methyl-deficient H3K4M mutant was sufficient to block these growth factor-induced copy gains ( FIG.  11 FIG.  12 12 FIG.  9 FIG.  12 12 FIG.  11 FIG.  12 Epigenetic Dysregulation Combined with Hypoxia or Increased EGF Induce Higher EGFR Copy Number We have identified a network of chromatin regulators and physiological signals that influence EGFR copy gains. In the case of hypoxia, KDM4A stabilization mirrors overexpression and promotes EGFR amplification, while EGF appears to promote EGFR amplification through KMT2A/SETD1A and targeting KDM4A ( FIG.  12 FIG.  13 FIG.  14 FIG.  13 13 FIG.  14 FIG.  13 13 13 FIG.  9 9 FIG.  14 14 Taken together, our data supports a model by which physiological triggers such as increased EGF concentration and/or hypoxia function in combination with epigenetic perturbation to directly modulate chromatin states and determine whether site-specific low or high copy DNA amplifications occur. Discussion To date, little knowledge exists about the molecular mechanisms that promote specific oncogene amplifications. We have uncovered epigenetic regulators and physiologic cues that facilitate amplification of the oncogene EGFR. Moreover, we provide show the ability to rheostat an oncogenic amplification through therapeutic intervention. These data illustrate a molecular basis for EGFR amplification and establish that the extra cellular microenvironment can directly contribute to DNA amplification heterogeneity in both normal and tumor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these copy gains are transient and that combined cues and/or epigenetic factor, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,705 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmanipulation are sufficient to promote higher copy number amplifications. Overall, we describe a series of key observations that demonstrate oncogenic amplification is hardwired into cells, providing a definable basis for cellular plasticity for EGFR copy number in both normal and cancer cells, which has significant clinical implications. Specificity, Crosstalk and Methylation States Prior studies have illustrated that both somatic and tumor cells have extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA; (11,55)) with key oncogenes such as MYC and EGFR occurring as ecDNA in as many as 50% of tumors (11). Early studies on extrachromosomal MYC demonstrated that the ecDNA harbored epigenetic states associated with active gene expression (56). Consistent with these observations, a recent study in somatic cells illustrated that ecDNAs were observed in gene-rich chromosomal regions (55), which suggested a relationship between their generation and actively marked loci. Our s evidence shows that by being able to directly promote or block such modifications through manipulation of histones, histone modifying enzymes and their upstream regulators such as hypoxia. The data presented within this manuscript illustrates a critical role for KMT-KDMs in balancing the methylation states controlling the repressive state (H3K9/27 methylation) and more accessible, active states (H3K4 methylation) so that EGFR amplification is either blocked or promoted. Methylation states appear to control the predilection of a region to amplify, however, not all enzymes controlling those states are responsible for generating the EGFR amplifications. For example, KDM4A and KDM5A were the only members within their lysine demethylase enzyme families to promote EGFR. However, the KDM6 family members, KDM6A and KDM6B, were both sufficient to generate EGFR amplification upon overexpression, which suggest that these enzymes could have functional redundancy at this locus in controlling H3K27me3 balance. These data highlight that enzyme families could have unique targets, and in certain cases, overlapping specificity. Similar observations were also true for KMTs targeting H3K4/9 methylation. For example, KMT2A/MLL1, SETD1A and SETD1B promoted EGFR amplification ( FIG.  9 FIG.  1 Data presented here implies that KDM4A utilizes the same mechanism to generate EGFR amplification as other previously mapped regions undergoing copy gains (e.g., 1921.3-CKS1B; (10,17,18)). KDM4A and KDM4B were shown to recruit the replication machinery and facilitate rereplication (10,18). Our previous studies also demonstrated that H3K4 methylation was key to the recruitment of KDM4 family members and the modulation of chromosome 1 targets, which was driven by select H3K4 KMTs (10). These previous studies did not observe a role for H3K27 methylation in controlling the TSSG formation (10,18). However, H3K27me3 was a key modulator of EGFR amplification. Indeed, EZH2 depletion and chemical inhibition promoted EGFR copy gains. EZH2 occupies, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Furthermore, H3K4 methylation interference or depletion of the KMT2 enzymes that control EGFR amplification completely blocked the EGFR copy gains generated by EZH2 suppression or inhibition. These data are consistent with the collection of studies illustrating an antagonistic relationship between these methylation states and the associated enzymes promoting H3K4/27 methylation balance (48). Our data is also consistent with a recent report demonstrating cross-talk between EZH2 and KMT2A disrupts H3K27 methylation balance, resulting in resistance to EZH2i monotherapy (57). Therefore, common principles assigned to gene regulation appear be true for TSSG regulation, which has direct clinical implications. Cues, Epigenetics and Targeting Heterogeneity Previous studies have illustrated EGFR amplification plasticity (12). EGFR copy gains can range from few in number to large clouds in the nuclei of cancer cells (see  FIG.  5 Consistent with the prior body of work suggesting certain extracellular cues (hypoxia and EGF) associate with tumor cells harboring EGFR amplification, we have now demonstrated that these stimuli directly control EGFR DNA copy number ( FIGS.  1 13 EGF treatment does not impact KDM4A levels but rather triggers EGFR amplification through two specific H3K4 KMTs-KMT2A/MLL1 and SETD1A. While both KMT2A and SETD1A controlled EGF-induced copy gains, SETD1B was dispensable, which highlights that enzymes can be selectively required under certain physiological conditions to generate DNA copy gains. Future studies should address whether other cellular signals or stresses could serve as important triggers to selectively activate or repress the enzymes required to generate amplification at EGFR and other TSSG sites. Understanding the triggers for amplifications will provide insights into tumor heterogeneity and uncover novel biomarkers and drug targets in controlling amplification. Consistent with these two pathways (hypoxia and EGF) working in parallel, when hypoxia is combined with KDM4A, there is little change in the low copy number (data not shown); however, when combined with increased H3K4 methylation there are higher copy number gains of EGFR per nucleus. The same is true when EGF is combined with KDM4A overexpression. These data illustrate that combining extracellular cues and epigenetic factor alterations promotes EGFR copy number generation and the degree of amplification. Given the range of EGFR amplification across tumors ( FIG.  1 Data presented within this manuscript is suggestive of two populations of EGFR DNA amplifications. For example, in cancer cell lines which exhibit significant DNA amplification of EGFR (e.g. HCC827 or HT-29 cells), these amplifications are reduced by modulation of K4 methylation via the introduction of a H3.3 K4M methyl-deficient mutant, or inhibition/depletion of KDM4A.

Future studies will need to investigate this in more detail, but these results could indicate a balance between integrated DNA copy number amplification and transient extrachromosomal amplifications of EGFR, the latter of which appears targetable with compounds directed towards epigenetic modifiers. In closing, we have uncovered both chromatin modifiers and extracellular signals that control EGFR amplification and demonstrate that epigenetic therapies could hold a key to modulating EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer and associated diseases, which could have significant clinical implications in the future. Example II Clinical Application of Methods for Modulating EGFR Expression Levels for Sensitizing Cancer Cells to EGFR Directed Therapies The results described in Example I elucidating the role methylation plays in EGFR DNA amplification have facilitated the design of strategies for treating the individuals based on the level of EGFR amplification in their particular cancer, and their response to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) therapies and related therapies. The effects of different compounds and their effects to modulate EGFRi therapies are summarized in  FIG.  15 FIG.  16 FIG.  5 5 One approach for sensitizing tumors to EGFRi or other related RTK therapies includes without limitation, determining the EGFR copy number by DNA FISH or other suitable method and assessing whether increased expression/amplification is present and modulation of copy numbers is in order. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that can alter downstream target genes expression by trimethylation of Lys-27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3). We have found that suppression of EZH2 is effective to increase EGFR amplification. EZH2 inhibitors are available, including the EZH1/2 dual inhibitors or inhibitors that disrupt EZH2 function such as EED inhibitors. An exemplary molecule includes tazemetostat by Epizyme. Tumors can be treated with EZH2 inhibitor for a suitable time to amplify the EGFR copy number above base line, followed by treatment EGFRi or related therapies. This strategy is consistent with the amplification levels we observed and the sensitivities previously shown in the colorectal cancer cell lines in Example I. In a similar fashion, KDM5 family or KDM5A specific inhibitors, which are also available, can be used to increase the gain levels and in turn enhance the therapeutic response to EGFRi. In a similar fashion, tumors with diploid copies should be pretreated and then treated with the EGFRi or related therapies. In certain cases, loss of EGFR DNA copies have been observed in certain tumors ( FIG.  1 16 16 In other aspects of the methods, the levels of the enzymes that promote the amplifications and prevent the amplifications are assessed at the protein, RNA and cellular localization level as this can, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

For example, if KDM4A expression is observed to be high, this fining correlates with EGFR amplification, and thus the ability to sensitize the tumor cells to EGFRi. In cases where low EZH2 levels are present, or mis-localization or mutations associated with function (direct or indirect of complex members, facilitating activity) are indicative of the suitability of EGFRi or related therapies. Notably, high EZH2 or KDM5A levels are likely to suppress EGFR copy gains and in turn prevent the response in conditions such as hypoxia. Accordingly, targeting these molecules should also promote amplification and sensitization to EGFRi. KMT2A, SETD1A or SETD1B overexpression also promotes EGFR amplification, rendering cells more sensitive to EGFRi. In cases where H3K9 KMT expression levels are reduced, we expect increased EGFR copies and in turn sensitivity of these tumor types to EGFRi or related therapies. Therefore, targeting these H3K9 KMTs (e.g., EHMT1) can be used to amplify EGFR and sensitize tumors. (80) Tumors with very high amplification (e.g., those with >8 copies or clouds measured as described in  FIGS.  1 5 16 16 FIG.  17 In a similar fashion, our data documents the plasticity of EGFR based on hypoxia and/or EGF, therefore, KDM4 family or KDM4A selective inhibitors can be used to reduce the EGFR heterogeneity within a tumor in order to achieve a more consistent response. Thus, in these types of tumors, one can also drive gains even higher through EZH2i or KDM5i in order to sensitize the tumor to drug.

More particularly, the invention relates to methods and compositions to treat Chronic MyeloMonocytic Leukemia (CMML). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most human adult cancers develop through a multistep acquisition of a wide range of somatic mutations that initiate or maintain self-renewal of the malignant clone. The last decade has seen the elucidation of the somatic mutational landscape of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (1, 2). These mutations are referenced in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and may provide potential novel insights into mechanisms underlying cancer. In myeloid malignancies, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) acquire specific combinations of leukemia disease alleles required to promote hematopoietic transformation (3, 4). Recent studies have shown that mutations in a small number of genes, including loss-of-function mutations in TET2 are common in the elderly and provide a proliferative advantage to hematopoietic stem cells giving rise to clonal hematopoiesis (5). Clonal hematopoiesis mutations are associated with about a 10-fold increase in risk of developing a hematological malignancy including myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias and a 2-3-fold risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are well known to be associated with a reduced risk of cardio vascular diseases (CVD). Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of lipid-altering therapies revealed that for every 10 mg/dL increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol level among trial participants, there was a 36% lower risk of cancer incidence during >625,000 person-years of follow-up and >8,000 incident cancers (6). While not establishing causation, this association suggests that HDL may be linked to tumor cell biology in humans. The ability of HDL and its apolipoproteins to promote efflux of cholesterol from cells depends in part on the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 but can also be mediated by scavenger receptor B1 and passive efflux pathways (7). Mice with defective cholesterol efflux in hematopoietic cells develop progressive myeloid expansion with an underlying dramatic HSPC expansion in the BM, an enhanced IL-3/GM-CSF signaling pathway and marked extramedullary hematopoiesis (13-16). We also demonstrated that HDL raising therapies could limit Mp1-W515L and Flt3-ITD-driven myeloproliferative disorders (17). Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is typically a disease of the elderly with few treatment options. Recent studies in CMML patients have shown changes reminiscent of those observed in mice with defective cholesterol efflux in hematopoietic cells including: 1) frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes encoding regulators of GM-CSF signaling (RAS, CBL), 2) hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor to GM-CSF and 3), Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

As used herein, the term “predicting” means that the subject to be analyzed by the method of the invention is allocated either into the group of subjects who will have or develop chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or into a group of subjects who will not have or develop CMML. Having or developing CMML referred to in accordance with the invention, particularly, means that the subject will have higher risk to have or develop CMML. Typically, said risk is elevated as compared to the average risk in a cohort of subjects suffering from CMML. In the context of the invention, the risk of having the CMML in a subject susceptible to suffer from CMML be predicted. The term “predicting the risk”, as used herein, refers to assessing the probability according to which the patient as referred to herein will have or develop CMML. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, such an assessment is usually not intended to be correct for 100% of the subjects to be investigated. The term, however, requires that prediction can be made for a statistically significant portion of subjects in a proper and correct manner. Whether a portion is statistically significant can be determined without further ado by the person skilled in the art using various well known statistic evaluation tools, e.g., determination of confidence intervals, p-value determination, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test etc. Details are found in Dowdy and Wearden, Statistics for Research, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1983. Preferred confidence intervals are at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99%. The p-values are, preferably, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, or 0.0001. Preferably, the probability envisaged by the invention allows that the prediction of an increased risk will be correct for at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%), or at least 90% of the subjects of a given cohort or population. As used herein, the term “subject” denotes a mammal, such as a rodent, a feline, a canine, and a primate. Particularly, the subject according to the invention is a human. More particularly, the subject according to the invention has or is susceptible to have chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). As used herein, the term “Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)” is a type of leukemia, which are cancers of the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. It is a rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 case per 100 000 persons per year. Median age at presentation is 70 years, and presenting manifestations may include those of bone marrow failure and systemic symptoms. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are found in some patients, and the white blood cell count is typically increased. CMML was reclassified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) (Jaffe et al., 2001) As used herein, the term “ABCA1” also known as the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

As used herein, the term “mutation” has its general meaning in the art and refers to any detectable change in genetic material, e.g. DNA, RNA, cDNA, or any process, mechanism, or result of such a change. This includes gene mutations, in which the structure (e.g. DNA sequence) of a gene is altered, any gene or DNA arising from any mutation process, and any expression product (e.g. protein or enzyme) expressed by a modified gene or DNA sequence. Mutations include deletion, insertion or substitution of one or more nucleotides. The mutation may occur in the coding region of a gene (i.e. in exons), in introns, or in the regulatory regions (e.g. enhancers, response elements, suppressors, signal sequences, polyadenylation sequences, promoters) of the gene. Generally a mutation is identified in a subject by comparing the sequence of a nucleic acid or polypeptide expressed by said subject with the corresponding nucleic acid or polypeptide expressed in a control population. Where the mutation is within the gene coding sequence, the mutation may be a “missense” mutation, where it replaces one amino acid with another in the gene product, or a “non sense” mutation, where it replaces an amino acid codon with a stop codon. A mutation may also occur in a splicing site where it creates or destroys signals for exon-intron splicing and thereby lead to a gene product of altered structure. A mutation in the genetic material may also be “silent”, i.e. the mutation does not result in an alteration of the amino acid sequence of the expression product. As used herein, the term “homozygous” refers to an individual possessing two copies of the same allele. As used herein, the term “homozygous mutant” refers to an individual possessing two copies of the same allele, such allele being characterized as the mutant form of a gene. As used herein, the term “heterozygous” refers to an individual possessing two different alleles of the same gene, i.e. an individual, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In a particular embodiment, the mutation allows to a truncated protein. Typically, truncated protein refers to a protein shortened by a mutation which specifically induces premature termination of messenger RNA translation. As used herein, the term “single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)” refers to is a single basepair variation in a nucleic acid sequence of ABCA1 gene. Polymorphisms can be referred to, for instance, by the nucleotide position at which the variation exists, by the change in amino acid sequence caused by the nucleotide variation, or by a change in some other characteristic of the nucleic acid molecule that is linked to the variation {e.g., an alteration of a secondary structure such as a stem-loop, or an alteration of the binding affinity of the nucleic acid for associated molecules, such as polymerases, RNases, and so forth). For example, the SNP in the context of the invention is missense mutation leading to the ABCA1-P711L, ABCA1-A1291T, ABCA1-G1421R, ABCA1-P1423S and ABCA1-A2011T in ABCA1. In the methods according to the present the invention, the presence or absence of a SNP can be determined by nucleic acid sequencing, PCR analysis or any genotyping method known in the art such as the method described in the example. Examples of such methods include, but are not limited to, chemical assays such as allele specific hybridization (DASH), pyrosequencing, molecular beacons, SNP microarrays, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), flap endonuclease (FEN), single strand conformation polymorphism, temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), high-resolution melting of the entire amplicon, and DNA mismatch-binding proteins. primer extension, allele specific oligonucleotide ligation, sequencing, enzymatic cleavage, flap endonuclease discrimination; and detection methods such as fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and mass spectrometry. For example, the presence or absence of said polymorphism may be detected in a DNA sample, preferably after amplification. For instance, the isolated DNA may be subjected to couple reverse transcription and amplification, such as reverse transcription and amplification by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using specific oligonucleotide primers that are specific for the polymorphism or that enable amplification of a region containing the polymorphism. According to a first alternative, conditions for primer annealing may be chosen to ensure specific reverse transcription (where appropriate) and amplification; so that the appearance of an amplification product be a diagnostic of the presence of the polymorphism according to the invention. Otherwise, DNA may be amplified, after which a mutated site may be detected in the amplified sequence by hybridization with a suitable probe or by direct sequencing, or any other appropriate method, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Currently numerous strategies for genotype analysis are available (Antonarakis et al., 1989; Cooper et al., 1991; Grompe, 1993). Briefly, the nucleic acid molecule may be tested for the presence or absence of a restriction site. When a base polymorphism creates or abolishes the recognition site of a restriction enzyme, this allows a simple direct PCR genotype the polymorphism. Further strategies include, but are not limited to, direct sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis; hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO) that are short synthetic probes which hybridize only to a perfectly matched sequence under suitably stringent hybridization conditions; allele specific PCR; PCR using mutagenic primers; ligase-PCR, HOT cleavage; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temperature denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (Kuklin et al., 1997). Direct sequencing may be accomplished by any method, including without limitation chemical sequencing, using the Maxam-Gilbert method; by enzymatic sequencing, using the Sanger method; mass spectrometry sequencing; pyrosequencing; sequencing using a chip-based technology and real-time quantitative PCR. Preferably, DNA from a patient is first subjected to amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific amplification primers. However several other methods are available, allowing DNA to be studied independently of PCR, such as the rolling circle amplification (RCA), the InvaderTMassay, or oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA). OLA may be used for revealing base polymorphisms. According to this method, two oligonucleotides are constructed that hybridize to adjacent sequences in the target nucleic acid, with the join sited at the position of the polymorphism. DNA ligase will covalently join the two oligonucleotides only if they are perfectly hybridized to one of the allele. Oligonucleotide probes or primers may contain at least 10, 15, 20 or 30 nucleotides. Their length may be shorter than 400, 300, 200 or 100 nucleotides. According to the invention, the determination of the presence or absence of said SNP may also be determined by detection or not of the mutated protein by any method known in the art. The presence of the protein of interest may be detected using standard electrophoretic and immunodiagnostic techniques, including immunoassays such as competition, direct reaction, or sandwich type assays. Such assays include, but are not limited to, Western blots; agglutination tests; enzyme-labelled and mediated immunoassays, such as ELISAs; biotin/avidin type assays; radioimmunoassays; immunoelectrophoresis; immunoprecipitation, etc. The reactions generally include revealing labels such as fluorescent, chemiluminescent, radioactive, enzymatic labels or dye molecules, or other methods for detecting the formation of a, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

As used herein, the term “labelled” with regard to the antibody or aptamer, is intended to encompass direct labelling of the antibody or aptamer by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance, such as a radioactive agent or a fluorophore (e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE) or indocyanine (Cy5), to the antibody or aptamer, as well as indirect labelling of the probe or antibody (e.g., horseradish peroxidise, HRP) by reactivity with a detectable substance. An antibody or aptamer may be also labelled with a radioactive molecule by any method known in the art. For example, radioactive molecules include but are not limited radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies such as 1123, 1124, In111, Re186 and Re188. The aforementioned assays generally involve separation of unbound protein in a liquid phase from a solid phase support to which antigen-antibody complexes are bound. Solid supports which may be used in the practice of the invention include substrates such as nitrocellulose (e.g., in membrane or microtiter well form); polyvinylchloride (e.g., sheets or microtiter wells); polystyrene latex (e.g., beads or microtiter plates); polyvinylidine fluoride; diazotized paper; nylon membranes; activated beads, magnetically responsive beads, etc. More particularly, an ELISA method may be used, wherein the wells of a microtiter plate are coated with an antibody against the protein to be tested. A biological sample containing or suspected of containing the marker protein is then added to the coated wells. After a period of incubation sufficient to allow the formation of antibody-antigen complexes, the plate (s) can be washed to remove unbound moieties and a detectably labelled secondary binding molecule added. The secondary binding molecule is allowed to react with any captured sample marker protein, the plate washed and the presence of the secondary binding molecule detected using methods well known in the art. Alternatively, an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method may be used. IHC specifically provides a method of detecting a target in a biological sample or tissue specimen in situ. The overall cellular integrity of the sample is maintained in IHC, thus allowing detection of both the presence and location of the target of interest. Typically a biological sample is fixed with formalin, embedded in paraffin and cut into sections for staining and subsequent inspection by light microscopy. Current methods of IHC use either direct labeling or secondary antibody-based or hapten-based labeling. Examples of known IHC systems include, for example, EnVision™ (DakoCytomation), Powervision® (Immunovision, Springdale, Ariz.), the NBA™ kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.), HistoFine® (Nichirei Corp, Tokyo, Japan).

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the SNP locus is detected by direct sequencing of a specified DNA segment containing the SNP locus of ABCA1. As used herein, the term “expression level” refers to the expression level of ABCA1 with further other values corresponding to the clinical parameters. Typically, the expression level of the gene may be determined by any technology known by a person skilled in the art. In particular, each gene expression level may be measured at the genomic and/or nucleic and/or protein level. In a particular embodiment, the expression level of ABCA1 gene is measured. The expression level of ABCA1 is assessed by analyzing the expression of the protein translated from said gene. Said analysis can be assessed using an antibody (e.g., a radio-labelled, chromophore-labelled, fluorophore-labelled, or enzyme-labelled antibody), an antibody derivative (e.g., an antibody conjugate with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein of a protein/ligand pair (e.g., biotin-streptavidin)), or an antibody fragment (e.g., a single-chain antibody, an isolated antibody hypervariable domain, etc.) which binds specifically to the protein translated from the gene encoding for ABCA1. Methods for measuring the expression level of ABCA1 in a sample may be assessed by any of a wide variety of well-known methods from one of skill in the art for detecting expression of a protein including, but not limited to, direct methods like mass spectrometry-based quantification methods, protein microarray methods, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (MA), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot analysis, ELISA, Luminex, ELISPOT and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and indirect methods based on detecting expression of corresponding messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). The mRNA expression profile may be determined by any technology known by a man skilled in the art. In particular, each mRNA expression level may be measured using any technology known by a man skilled in the art, including nucleic microarrays, quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), next generation sequencing and hybridization with a labelled probe. Said direct analysis can be assessed by contacting the sample with a binding partner capable of selectively interacting with the biomarker present in the sample. The binding partner may be an antibody that may be polyclonal or monoclonal, preferably monoclonal (e.g., a isotope-label, element-label, radio-labelled, chromophore-labelled, fluorophore-labelled, or enzyme-labelled antibody), an antibody derivative (e.g., an antibody conjugate with a substrate or with the protein or ligand of a protein of a protein/ligand pair (e.g., biotin-streptavidin)), or an antibody fragment (e.g., a single-chain antibody, an isolated antibody hypervariable domain, etc.) which binds, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In a particular embodiment, the bead may be a cytometric bead for use in flow cytometry. Such beads may for example correspond to BD™ Cytometric Beads commercialized by BD Biosciences (San Jose, Calif.). Typically cytometric beads may be suitable for preparing a multiplexed bead assay. A multiplexed bead assay, such as, for example, the BD™ Cytometric Bead Array, is a series of spectrally discrete beads that can be used to capture and quantify soluble antigens. Typically, beads are labelled with one or more spectrally distinct fluorescent dyes, and detection is carried out using a multiplicity of photodetectors, one for each distinct dye to be detected. A number of methods of making and using sets of distinguishable beads have been described in the literature. These include beads distinguishable by size, wherein each size bead is coated with a different target-specific antibody (see e.g. Fulwyler and McHugh, 1990, Methods in Cell Biology 33:613-629), beads with two or more fluorescent dyes at varying concentrations, wherein the beads are identified by the levels of fluorescence dyes (see e.g. European Patent No. 0 126,450), and beads distinguishably labelled with two different dyes, wherein the beads are identified by separately measuring the fluorescence intensity of each of the dyes (see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,499,052 and 4,717,655). Both one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays for the simultaneous analysis of multiple antigens by flow cytometry are available commercially. Examples of one-dimensional arrays of singly dyed beads distinguishable by the level of fluorescence intensity include the BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) and Cyto-Plex™ Flow Cytometry microspheres (Duke Scientific, Palo Alto, Calif.). An example of a two-dimensional array of beads distinguishable by a combination of fluorescence intensity (five levels) and size (two sizes) is the QuantumPlex™ microspheres (Bangs Laboratories, Fisher, Ind.). An example of a two-dimensional array of doubly-dyed beads distinguishable by the levels of fluorescence of each of the two dyes is described in Fulton et al.

Predetermined reference values used for comparison may comprise “cut-off” or “threshold” values that may be determined as described herein. Each reference (“cut-off”) value for ABCA1 may be predetermined by carrying out a method comprising the steps of a) providing a collection of samples from subjects at risk of having or developing CMML; b) determining the expression level of ABCA1 protein for each sample contained in the collection provided at step a); c) ranking the biological samples according to said expression level; d) classifying said samples in pairs of subsets of increasing, respectively decreasing, number of members ranked according to their expression level, e) providing, for each sample provided at step a), information relating to the risk of having or developing CMML or the actual clinical outcome for the corresponding subject (i.e. the duration of the overall survival (OS)); f) for each pair of subsets of samples, obtaining a Kaplan Meier percentage of survival curve; g) for each pair of subsets of samples calculating the statistical significance (p value) between both subsets; h) selecting as reference value for the expression level, the value of expression level for which the p value is the smallest. For example the expression level of ABCA1 has been assessed for 100 samples of 100 patients. The 100 samples are ranked according to their expression level. Sample 1 has the best expression level and sample 100 has the worst expression level. A first grouping provides two subsets: on one side sample Nr 1 and on the other side the 99 other samples. The next grouping provides on one side samples 1 and 2 and on the other side the 98 remaining samples etc., until the last grouping: on one side samples 1 to 99 and on the other side sample Nr 100. According to the information relating to the actual clinical outcome for the corresponding patient, Kaplan Meier curves are prepared for each of the 99 groups of two subsets. Also for each of the 99 groups, the p value between both subsets was calculated. The reference value is selected such as the discrimination based on the criterion of the minimum p value is the strongest. In other terms, the expression level corresponding to the boundary between both subsets for which the p value is minimum is considered as the reference value. It should be noted that the reference value is not necessarily the median value of expression levels. In routine work, the reference value (cut-off value) may be used in the present method to discriminate samples and therefore the corresponding patients.

 In the present invention, inventors have used high throughput sequencing to identify novel mutations in ABCA1 in CM ML patient samples. Further studies in a mouse model of myelomonocytic leukemia driven by hematopoietic Tet2 deficiency have shown that these somatic mutations abrogate the tumor suppressor function of WT ABCA1, resulting in the failure to suppress canonical IL3-receptor beta signaling-driven myelopoiesis. The loss of the myelo-suppressive function of ABCA1 mutants can be overcome by raising HDL levels through overexpression of the human apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1) transgene. Inventors have also shown that both IL-3Rbeta blocking antibody and cyclodextrin prevented the proliferation of ABCA1 mutant-transduced Tet2 deficient BM cells similar to the effect of ABCA1-WT overexpression. Accordingly, the invention relates to a method for predicting the survival time of a subject NI suffering from CM ML comprising the step identifying at least one ABCA1 and to a method for treating said subject with HDL/ABCA recombinant (ApoA-1); cylodextrin and/or anti-IL-3Rbeta antibody., Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Said ASCII copy, created on Jun. 24, 2022, is named S1961.70008US03-SEQ and is 3,454 bytes in size. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to methods and systems for identifying disease-induced mutations, such as caused by cancer. The invention additionally provides methods for identifying mutations that may be causative of advanced disease, such as metastatic cancers. BACKGROUND Many diseases result from inherited or random mutations in a patient's genetic sequence. Additionally, in diseases such as cancer, advanced stages of disease may manifest as new changes in the genetic sequence of diseased cells. Accordingly, there is increased interest in sequencing diseased cells, e.g., from a biopsy or freely circulating, to determine the type or stage of a disease. Thus, patients who have undergone treatment for a disease may have new biopsy samples sequenced to monitor disease recurrence and/or progression. Such monitoring allows for early intervention in the event of recurrence, and also avoids unnecessary treatment when changes are not detected. While there are many diseases that can be typed and tracked with genetic screening, cancer mutation screening has received the most attention. In some instances, the type of cancer can be immediately identified because of one tell-tale mutation, such as BRCA1. In most instances, however, cancer typing involves discovering and analyzing several sequences from a patient. Because these samples originate from the same patient, the samples are not independent of each other, but rather, are interrelated both developmentally and structurally. Furthermore, in most instances, accurate typing of a tumor requires knowledge of three sequences: the subject's healthy sequence (as found in non-cancerous parts of the body), the sequence of a major cancerous clone, and the sequences of minor clones (which may often be metastatic). The prospect of sequencing several samples to obtain a complete picture of a disease is less intimidating due to recent advances in genetic, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,759 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textsequencing. Next-generation sequencing (e.g., whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing, pyrosequencing, ion semiconductor sequencing, sequencing by synthesis) can generate millions of reads, covering an entire genome, in just a few days. To achieve this throughput, NGS sequencing uses massive parallelization on smaller nucleic acid sequences that together make up a larger body of genetic information, e.g., a chromosome or a genome. Starting from a genetic sample, the nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) are broken up, amplified, and read with extreme speed. Once the reads are produced, the reads are aligned to a reference genome, e.g., GRCh37, with a computer to produce longer, assembled sequences, known as contigs. Because the sequence data from next generation sequencers often comprises millions of shorter sequences that together represent the totality of the target sequence, aligning the reads is complex and computationally expensive. Additionally, in order to minimize sequence distortions caused by random sequencing errors (i.e., incorrect sequencing machine outputs), each portion of the probed sequence is sequenced multiple times (e.g., 2 to 100 times, or more) to minimize the influence of any random sequencing errors on the final alignments and output sequences generated. Once all of the data, corresponding to all of the nucleic acid reads is collected, and the reads are aligned against the reference, the reads are assembled and compared to the reference, as well as to each other, to determine the relationship between the samples. The workflow for this analysis is shown pictorially in  FIG.  1 The workflow illustrated in  FIG.  1 Typically a sequence alignment is constructed by aggregating pairwise alignments between two linear strings of sequence information, one of which is a standard reference. As an example of alignment, two strings, Si (SEQ ID NO. 15: AGCTACGTACACTACC) and S2 (SEQ ID NO. 16: AGCTATCGTACTAGC) can be aligned against each other. Si typically corresponds to a read and S2 correspond to a portion of the reference sequence. With respect to each other, S1 and S2 can consist of substitutions, deletions, and insertions. Typically, the terms are defined with regard to transforming string Si into string S2: a substitution occurs when a letter or sequence in S2 is replaced by a different letter or sequence of the same length in S1, a deletion occurs when a letter or sequence in S2 is “skipped” in the corresponding section of S1, and an insertion occurs when a letter or sequence occurs in Si between two positions that are adjacent in S2. For example, the two sequences Si and S2 can be aligned as below. The alignment below represents thirteen matches, a deletion of length one, an insertion of length two, and one substitution:, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In particular, because portions of the sequence construct can be tagged with secondary information, such as “metastatic,” the subsequent step of comparing a mutation, vis-à-vis the reference genome, to a table of known mutations can be eliminated. Thus, it is merely a matter of identifying a sample as being aligned to sequences in the construct that are indicative of the disease or stage. Alternatively, when a mutation is not known (i.e., not represented in the reference sequence construct), an alignment will be found, whereby the variant can be identified as a new mutation. Thus, using this iterative process, it is possible to compare and/or identify differences between major and minor cancer clones, or between pre-cancerous and cancerous samples. The invention additionally includes systems for executing the methods of the invention. In one embodiment, a system comprises a distributed network of processors and storage capable of comparing a plurality of sequences (i.e., nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences) to a reference sequence construct (e.g., a DAG) representing observed variation in a genome or a region of a genome. The system is additionally capable of aligning the nucleic acid reads to produce a continuous sequence using an efficient alignment algorithm. Because the reference sequence construct compresses a great deal of redundant information, and because the alignment algorithm is so efficient, the reads can be tagged and assembled on an entire genome using commercially-available resources. The system comprises a plurality of processors that simultaneously execute a plurality of comparisons between a plurality of reads and the reference sequence construct. The comparison data may be accumulated and provided to a health care provider. Because the comparisons are computationally tractable, analyzing sequence reads will no longer represent a bottleneck between NGS sequencing and a meaningful discussion of a patient's genetic risks., Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Once constructed, these reference sequence constructs can be used to align sequence reads corresponding to genetic samples from patients suspected of having a disease, or who have had the disease and are in suspected remission. The aligned sequences give immediate information about the nature of the samples, e.g., being of a metastatic nature. Thus, the reference sequence constructs can be used to monitor patients for recurrence or progression of a disease, such as cancer. The reference sequence constructs can also be used to study structural relationships between diseases and/or between disease states. The reference sequence constructs can be fabricated from previously determined variant files, or the reference sequence constructs can be created de novo, e.g., from samples originating from a patient. In some embodiments, the reference sequence constructs are directed acyclic graphs (DAG), as described below, however the reference sequence can be any representation reflecting genetic variability in the sequences of different organisms within a species, provided the construct is formatted for alignment. The genetic variability represented in the construct may be between different tissues or cells within an individual. The genetic variability represented in the construct may be between different individuals or between different organisms. The genetic variability represented in the construct may be between similar tissues or cells that are at different stages of a disease. In general, the reference sequence construct will comprise portions that are identical and portions that vary between sampled sequences. Accordingly, the constructs can be thought of as having positions (i.e., according to some canonical ordering) that comprise the same sequence(s) and some positions that comprise alternative sequences, reflecting genetic variability. The application additionally discloses methods for identifying a disease or a disease stage based upon alignment of a nucleic acid read to a location in the construct. The methods are broadly applicable to the fields of genetic sequencing and mutation screening. Reference Sequence Constructs Unlike prior art sequence alignment methods that use a single reference sequence to align and genotype nucleic acid reads, the invention uses a construct that can account for the variability in genetic sequences within a species, population, or even among different cells in a single organism. Representations of the genetic variation can be presented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) (discussed above) or, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In preferred embodiments of the invention, the construct is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), i.e., having a direction and having no cyclic paths. (That is, a sequence path cannot travel through a position on the reference construct more than once.) In the DAG, genetic variation in a sequence is represented as alternate nodes. The nodes can be a section of conserved sequence or a gene, or simply a nucleic acid. The different possible paths through the construct represent known genetic variation. A DAG may be constructed for an entire genome of an organism, or the DAG may be constructed only for a portion of the genome, e.g., a chromosome, or smaller segment of genetic information. In some embodiments, the DAG represents greater than 1000 nucleic acids, e.g., greater than 10,000 nucleic acids, e.g., greater than 100,000 nucleic acids, e.g., greater than 1,000,000 nucleic acids. A DAG may represent a species (e.g., horno sapiens) or a selected population (e.g., women having breast cancer), or even smaller subpopulations, such as genetic variation among different tumor cells in the same individual. A simple example of DAG construction is shown in  FIG.  2 FIG.  2 FIG.  2 FIG.  2 At the next step, a variant is added to the reference sequence, as shown in the bottom image of  FIG.  1 FIG.  1 In practice, the variants are called to the DAG by applying the entries in a variant call format (VCF) file, such as can be found at the 1000 Genomes Project website. Because each VCF file is keyed to a specific reference genome, it is not difficult to identify where the strings should be located. In fact, each entry in a VCF file can be thought of as combining with the reference to create separate graph, as displayed in  FIG.  3 FIG.  2 FIG.  2 FIG.  3 Moving to  FIG.  2 In practice, the DAGs are represented in computer memory (hard disk, FLASH, cloud memory, etc.) as a set of nodes, S, wherein each node is defined by a string, a set of parent nodes, and a position. The string is the node's “content,” i.e., sequence; the parent nodes define the node's position with respect to the other nodes in the graph; and the position of the node is relative to some canonical ordering in the system, e.g., the reference genome. While it is not strictly necessary to define the graph with respect to a reference sequence, it does make manipulation of the output data simpler. Of course, a further constraint on S is that it cannot include loops. In many embodiments, the nodes comprise a plurality of characters, as shown in  FIGS.  2 2 FIG.  3 Extrapolating this DAG method to larger structures, it is possible to construct DAGs that incorporate thousands of VCF entries representing the known variation in genetic sequences for a given region of a reference.

While the equations above are represented as “maximum” values, “maximum” is intended to cover any form of optimization, including, for example, switching the signs on all of the equations and solving for a minimum value. Implementation of the disclosed algorithm is exemplified in  FIG.  4 FIG.  4 FIG.  4 FIG.  4 FIG.  4 Fabricating Constructs to Accommodate Disease Variability As mentioned above, the reference sequence construct can be prepared from existing variant files, or the construct can be prepared de novo, by comparing certain sampled sequences to a reference sequence. An example of such de novo construction is shown in  FIG.  5 Taking the example to the next level, the variants between the non-diseased and major clone sample can be incorporated into a new reference construct, “Reference with major clone” as shown in  FIG.  5 FIG.  6 FIG.  6 FIG.  6 This construct in  FIG.  6 The reference sequence construct shown in  FIG.  6 FIG.  7 FIG.  6 The process of aligning new samples to the reference sequence construct and then subsequently adding the newly-identified variants to the construct to create a new construct can be repeated indefinitely. In reality, because the reference sequence constructs are multivariate constructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium, the addition of new structures is trivial. Furthermore, the alignment of new reads to these highly complex reference constructs is computationally feasible and far less taxing than comparing new reads to each previous sequence individually. The process of aligning and improving on the constructs can be done in parallel, as shown in  FIG.  8 FIG.  9 Opportunities for Parallelization The sequential version of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm has been adapted and significantly modified for massive parallelization. For example, an ASC model, called Smith-Waterman using Associative Massive Parallelism (SWAMP) is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0239706, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Part of the parallelization for SWAMP (and other parallel processing systems) stems from the fact that the values along any anti-diagonal are independent of each other. Thus, all of the cells along a given anti-diagonal can be done in parallel to distribute the computational resources. The data dependencies shown in the above recursive equations limit the level of achievable parallelism but using a wavefront approach will still speed up this useful algorithm.

Parallel Computing Models The main parallel model used to develop and extend Smith-Waterman sequence alignment is the ASsociative Computing (ASC) (Potter et al.,  Computer,  Some relevant vocabulary is defined here. Two terms of interest from Flynn's Taxonomy of computer architectures are MIMD and SIMD, two different models of parallel computing. A cluster of computers, classified as a multiple-instruction, multiple-data (MIMD) model is used as a proof-of-concept to overcome memory limitations in extremely large-scale alignments. Section 8 describes usage of the MIMD model. An extended data-parallel, single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) model known as ASC is also described. Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) The multiple-data, multiple-instruction model or MIMD model describes the majority of parallel systems currently available, and include the currently popular cluster of computers. The MIMD processors have a full-fledged central processing unit (CPU), each with its own local memory (Quinn, Parallel Computing: Theory and Practice, 2nd ed., New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994). In contrast to the SIMD model, each of the MIMD processors stores and executes its own program asynchronously. The MIMD processors are connected via a network that allows them to communicate but the network used can vary widely, ranging from an Ethernet, Myrinet, and InfiniBand connection between machines (cluster nodes). The communications tend to employ a much looser communications structure than SIMDs, going outside of a single unit. The data is moved along the network asynchronously by individual processors under the control of their individual program they are executing. Typically, communication is handled by one of several different parallel languages that support message-passing. A very common library for this is known as the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Communication in a “SIMD-like” fashion is possible, but the data movements will be asynchronous. Parallel computations by MIMDs usually require extensive communication and frequent synchronizations unless the various tasks being executed by the processors are highly independent (i.e. the so-called “embarrassingly parallel” or “pleasingly parallel” problems). The work presented in Section 8 uses an AMD Opteron cluster connected via InfiniBand. Unlike SIMDs, the worst-case time required for the message-passing is difficult or impossible to predict. Typically, the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,777 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmessage-passing execution time for MIMD software is determined using the average case estimates, which are often determined by trial, rather than by a worst case theoretical evaluation, which is typical for SIMDs. Since the worst case for MIMD software is often very bad and rarely occurs, average case estimates are much more useful. As a result, the communication time required for a MIMD on a particular problem can be and is usually significantly higher than for a SIMD. This leads to the important goal in MIMD programming (especially when message-passing is used) to minimize the number of inter-processor communications required and to maximize the amount of time between processor communications. This is true even at a single card acceleration level, such as using graphics processors or GPUs. Data-parallel programming is also an important technique for MIMD programming, but here all the tasks perform the same operation on different data and are only synchronized at various critical points. The majority of algorithms for MIMD systems are written in the Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) programming paradigm. Each processor has its own copy of the same program, executing the sections of the code specific to that processor or core on its local data. The popularity of the SPMD paradigm stems from the fact that it is quite difficult to write a large number of different programs that will be executed concurrently across different processors and still be able to cooperate on solving a single problem. Another approach used for memory-intensive but not compute-intensive problems is to create a virtual memory server, as is done with JumboMem, using the work presented in Section 8. This uses MPI in its underlying implementation. Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) The SIMD model consists of multiple, simple arithmetic processing elements called PEs. Each PE has its own local memory that it can fetch and store from, but it does not have the ability to compile or execute a program. As used herein, the term “parallel memory” refers to the local memories, collectively, in a computing system. For example, a parallel memory can be the collective of local memories in a SIMD computer system (e.g., the local memories of PEs), the collective of local memories of the processors in a MIMD computer system (e.g., the local memories of the central processing units) and the like. The compilation and execution of programs are handled by a processor called a control unit (or front end) (Quinn,  Parallel Computing: Theory and Practice,  All active PEs execute the program instructions received from the control unit synchronously in lockstep. “In any time unit, a single operation is in the same state of execution on multiple processing units, each manipulating different data” (Quinn,  Parallel Computing: Theory and Practice,  Data can be broadcast to all active PEs by the control unit and the control unit can also obtain data values from a particular PE using the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,778 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textconnection (usually a bus) between the control unit and the PEs. Additionally, the set of PE are connected by an interconnection network, such as a linear array, 2-D mesh, or hypercube that provides parallel data movement between the PEs. Data is moved through this network in synchronous parallel fashion by the PEs, which execute the instructions including data movement, in lockstep. It is the control unit that broadcasts the instructions to the PEs. In particular, the SIMD network does not use the message-passing paradigm used by most parallel computers today. An important advantage of this is that SIMD network communication is extremely efficient and the maximum time required for the communication can be determined by the worst-case time of the algorithm controlling that particular communication. The remainder of this section is devoted to describing the extended SIMD ASC model. ASC is at the center of the algorithm design and development for this discussion. Associative Computing Model The ASsocative Computing (ASC) model is an extended SIMD based on the STARAN associative SIMD computer, designed by Dr. Kenneth Batcher at Goodyear Aerospace and its heavily Navy-utilized successor, the ASPRO. Developed within the Department of Computer Science at Kent State University, ASC is an algorithmic model for associative computing (Potter et al., Computer, 27(11):19-25, 1994) (Potter,  Associative Computing: A Programming Paradigm for Massively Parallel Computers, Plenum Publishing,  As an extended SIMD model, ASC uses synchronous data-parallel programming, avoiding both multi-tasking and asynchronous point-to-point communication routing. Multi-tasking is unnecessary since only one task is executed at any time, with multiple instances of this task executed in lockstep on all active processing elements (PEs). ASC, like SIMD programmers, avoid problems involving load balancing, synchronization, and dynamic task scheduling, issues that must be explicitly handled in MPI and other MIMD cluster paradigms. FIG.  10 As seen in  FIG.  10 Computer,  The tabular nature of the algorithm lends itself to computation using ASC due to the natural tabular structure of ASC data structures. Highly efficient communication across the PE interconnection network for the lockstep shifting of data of the north and northwest neighbors, and the fast constant time associative functions for searching and for maximums across the parallel computations are well utilized by SWAMP The associative operations are executed in constant time (Jin et al., 15th  International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium  Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems  J. of Parallel and Distributed Computing  JPDC The control unit fetches and decodes program instructions and broadcasts control signals to the PEs. The PEs, under the direction of the control unit, execute these instructions using their own local data. All PEs execute instructions in a lockstep manner, with an implicit, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,778 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textsynchronization between instructions. ASC has several relevant high-speed global operations: associative search, maximum/minimum search, and responder selection/detection. These are described in the following section. Associative Functions The functions relevant to the SWAMP algorithms are discussed below. Associative Search The basic operation in an ASC algorithm is the associative search. An associative search simultaneously locates the PEs whose local data matches a given search key. Those PEs that have matching data are called responders and those with non-matching data are called non-responders. After performing a search, the algorithm can then restrict further processing to only affect the responders by disabling the non-responders (or vice versa). Performing additional searches may further refine the set of responders. Associative search is heavily utilized by SWAMP+in selecting which PEs are active within a parallel act within a diagonal. Maximum/Minimum Search In addition to simple searches, where each PE compares its local data against a search key using a standard comparison operator (equal, less than, etc.), an associative computer can also perform global searches, where data from the entire PE array is combined together to determine the set of responders. The most common type of global search is the maximum/minimum search, where the responders are those PEs whose data is the maximum or minimum value across the entire PE array. The maximum value is used by SWAMP+ in every diagonal it processes to track the highest value calculated so far. Use of the maximum search occurs frequently, once in a logical parallel act, m+n times per alignment. Responder Selection/Detection An associative search can result in multiple responders and an associative algorithm can process those responders in one of three different modes: parallel, sequential, or single selection. Parallel responder processing performs the same set of operations on each responder simultaneously. Sequential responder processing selects each responder individually, allowing a different set of operations for each responder. Single responder selection (also known as pickOne) selects one, arbitrarily chosen, responder to undergo processing. In addition to multiple responders, it is also possible for an associative search to result in no responders. To handle this case, the ASC model can detect whether there were any responders to a search and perform a separate set of actions in that case (known as anyResponders). In SWAMP, multiple responders that contain characters to be aligned are selected and processed in parallel, based on the associative searches mentioned above. Single responder selection occurs if and when there are multiple values that have the exact same maximum value when using the maximum/minimum search. PE Interconnection Network Most associative processors include some type of PE interconnection network to allow parallel data movement within the array. The ASC model, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,778 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textitself does not specify any particular interconnection network and, in fact, many useful associative algorithms do not require one. Typically associative processors implement simple networks such as 1D linear arrays or 2D meshes. These networks are simple to implement and allow data to be transferred quickly in a synchronous manner. The 1D linear array is sufficient for the explicit communication between PEs in the SWAMP algorithms, for example. Parallel Computing Systems A generalized parallel processing architecture is shown in  FIG.  11 Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as Uniform Memory Access (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access. Processor—processor and processor—memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or multiplexed) memory, a crossbar switch, a shared bus or an interconnect network of a myriad of topologies including star, ring, tree, hypercube, fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor at a node), or n-dimensional mesh. Parallel computers based on interconnected networks must incorporate routing to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines. Such resources are commercially available for purchase for dedicated use, or these resources can be accessed via “the cloud,” e.g., Amazon Cloud Computing. A computer generally includes a processor coupled to a memory via a bus. Memory can include RAM or ROM and preferably includes at least one tangible, non-transitory medium storing instructions executable to cause the system to perform functions described herein. As one skilled in the art would recognize as necessary or best-suited for performance of the methods of the invention, systems of the invention include one or more processors (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), etc.), computer-readable storage devices (e.g., main memory, static memory, etc.), or combinations thereof which communicate with each other via a bus. A processor may be any suitable processor known in the art, such as the processor sold under the trademark XEON E7 by Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) or the processor sold under the trademark OPTERON 6200 by AMD (Sunnyvale, Calif.). Memory may refer to a computer-readable storage device and can include any machine-readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions (e.g., software embodying any methodology or function found herein), data (e.g., embodying any tangible physical objects such as the genetic sequences found, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The term “computer-readable storage device” shall accordingly be taken to include, without limit, solid-state memories (e.g., subscriber identity module (SIM) card, secure digital card (SD card), micro SD card, or solid-state drive (SSD)), optical and magnetic media, and any other tangible storage media. Preferably, a computer-readable storage device includes a tangible, non-transitory medium. Such non-transitory media excludes, for example, transitory waves and signals. “Non-transitory memory” should be interpreted to exclude computer readable transmission media, such as signals, per se. Input/output devices according to the invention may include a video display unit (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor), an alphanumeric input device (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device (e.g., a mouse or trackpad), a disk drive unit, a signal generation device (e.g., a speaker), a touchscreen, an accelerometer, a microphone, a cellular radio frequency antenna, and a network interface device, which can be, for example, a network interface card (NIC), Wi-Fi card, or cellular modem. Sample Acquisition and Preparation The invention includes methods for producing sequences (e.g., nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences) corresponding to nucleic acids recovered from biological samples. In some embodiments the resulting information can be used to identify mutations present in nucleic acid material obtained from a subject. In some embodiments, a sample, i.e., nucleic acids (e.g. DNA or RNA) are obtained from a subject, the nucleic acids are processed (lysed, amplified, and/or purified) and the nucleic acids are sequenced using a method described below. In many embodiments, the result of the sequencing is not a linear nucleic acid sequence, but a collection of thousands or millions of individual short nucleic acid reads that must be re-assembled into a sequence for the subject. Once the reads are aligned to produce a sequence, the aligned sequence can be compared to reference sequences to identify mutations that may be indicative of disease, for example. In other embodiments, the subject may be identified with particular mutations based upon the alignment of the reads against a reference sequence construct, i.e., a directed acyclic graph (“DAG”) as described above. For any of the above purposes, methods may be applied to biological samples. The biological samples may, for example, comprise samples of blood, whole blood, blood plasma, tears, nipple aspirate, serum, stool, urine, saliva, circulating cells, tissue, biopsy samples, hair follicle or other, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,778 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textsamples containing biological material of the patient. One issue in conducting tests based on such samples is that, in most cases only a tiny amount of DNA or RNA containing a mutation of interest may be present in a sample. This is especially true in non-invasive samples, such as a buccal swab or a blood sample, where the mutant nucleic acids are present in very small amounts. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid fragments may be naturally short, that is, random shearing of relevant nucleic acids in the sample can generate short fragments. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids are purposely fragmented for ease of processing or because the sequencing techniques can only sequence reads of less than 1000 bases, e.g., less than 500 bases, e.g., less than 200 bases, e.g., less than 100 bases, e.g., less than 50 bases. While the methods described herein can be used to align sequences of varying length, in some embodiments, the majority of the plurality of nucleic acid reads will follow from the sequencing method and comprise less than 1000 bases, e.g., less than 500 bases, e.g., less than 200 bases, e.g., less than 100 bases, e.g., less than 50 bases. Nucleic acids may be obtained by methods known in the art. Generally, nucleic acids can be extracted from a biological sample by a variety of techniques such as those described by Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y., pp. 280-281, (1982), the contents of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. It may be necessary to first prepare an extract of the sample and then perform further steps—i.e., differential precipitation, column chromatography, extraction with organic solvents and the like—in order to obtain a sufficiently pure preparation of nucleic acid. Extracts may be prepared using standard techniques in the art, for example, by chemical or mechanical lysis of the cell. Extracts then may be further treated, for example, by filtration and/or centrifugation and/or with chaotropic salts such as guanidinium isothiocyanate or urea or with organic solvents such as phenol and/or HCCl3 to denature any contaminating and potentially interfering proteins. In some embodiments, the sample may comprise RNA, e.g., mRNA, collected from a subject sample, e.g., a blood sample. General methods for RNA extraction are well known in the art and are disclosed in standard textbooks of molecular biology, including Ausubel et al., Current Protocols of Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons (1997).

(San Diego, Calif.) following the isolation of RNA and reverse transcription, the obtained cDNA is spiked with a synthetic DNA molecule (competitor), which matches the targeted cDNA region in all positions, except a single base, and serves as an internal standard. The cDNA/competitor mixture is PCR amplified and is subjected to a post-PCR shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) enzyme treatment, which results in the dephosphorylation of the remaining nucleotides. After inactivation of the alkaline phosphatase, the PCR products from the competitor and cDNA are subjected to primer extension, which generates distinct mass signals for the competitor- and cDNA-derives PCR products. After purification, these products are dispensed on a chip array, which is pre-loaded with components needed for analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. The cDNA present in the reaction is then quantified by analyzing the ratios of the peak areas in the mass spectrum generated. For further details see, e.g. Ding and Cantor, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Novel methods have now been disclosed for detecting the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocations in  B. napus B. napus.  Definitions Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure relates. In case of conflict, the present application including the definitions will control. Unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. All publications, patents and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference, unless only specific sections of patents or patent publications are indicated to be incorporated by reference. In order to further clarify this disclosure, the following terms, abbreviations and definitions are provided. As used herein, the terms “comprises”, “comprising”, “includes”, “including”, “has”, “having”, “contains”,” or “containing”, or any other variation thereof, are intended to be non-exclusive or open-ended. For example, a composition, a mixture, a process, a method, an article, or an apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present). Also, the indefinite articles “a” and “an” preceding an element or component of an embodiment of the disclosure are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances, i.e., occurrences of the element or component. Therefore “a” or “an” should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular. The term “invention” or “present invention” as used herein is a non-limiting term and is not intended to refer to any single embodiment of the particular invention but encompasses all possible embodiments as disclosed in the application. “Amplification” is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (i.e., replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (i.e., synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,889 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textspecificity is frequently described in terms of “target” specificity. Target sequences are “targets” in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques were designed primarily for this sorting out. As used herein, the term “polymerase chain reaction” and “PCR” generally refers to the method for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,965,188; herein incorporated by reference). This process for amplifying the target sequence comprises introducing an excess of two oligonucleotide primers to the DNA mixture containing the desired target sequence, followed by a precise sequence of thermal cycling in the presence of a DNA polymerase. The two primers are complementary to their respective strands of the double stranded target sequence. To effect amplification, the mixture is denatured and the primers then annealed to their complementary sequences within the target molecule. Following annealing, the primers are extended with a polymerase so as to form a new pair of complementary strands. The steps of denaturation, primer annealing and polymerase extension can be repeated many times (i.e., denaturation, annealing and extension constitute one “cycle”; there can be numerous “cycles”) to obtain a high concentration of an amplified segment of the desired target sequence. The length of the amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of the primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the “polymerase chain reaction” (hereinafter “PCR”). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be “PCR amplified. Term “amplicon” refers to as natural or manually amplification event (for example, polymerase chain reaction) product formation Polynucleotides (for example, DNA) segment. In some embodiments, amplicon “length” amplicon, and the length is at least 5 kb, or At least 6 kb, 7 kb, 8 kb, 9 kb, 10 kb, 11 kb, 12 kb, 13 kb, 14 kb, 15 kb, 16 kb, 17 kb, 18 kb, 1.9 kb, or 20 kb. The term “isolated”, as used herein means having been removed from its natural environment, or removed from other compounds present when the compound is first formed. The term “isolated” embraces materials isolated from natural sources as well as materials (e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) recovered after preparation by recombinant expression in a host cell, or chemically-synthesized compounds such as nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and peptides. The term “purified”, as used herein relates to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The term “purified nucleic acid” is used herein to describe a nucleic acid sequence which has been separated, produced apart from, or purified away from other biological compounds including, but not limited to polypeptides, lipids and carbohydrates, while effecting a chemical or functional change in the component (e.g., a nucleic acid may be purified from a chromosome by removing protein contaminants and breaking chemical bonds connecting the nucleic acid to the remaining DNA in the chromosome). The term “synthetic”, as used herein refers to a polynucleotide (i.e., a DNA or RNA) molecule that was created via chemical synthesis as an in vitro process. For example, a synthetic DNA may be created during a reaction within an Eppendorf™ tube, such that the synthetic DNA is enzymatically produced from a native strand of DNA or RNA. Other laboratory methods may be utilized to synthesize a polynucleotide sequence. Oligonucleotides may be chemically synthesized on an oligo synthesizer via solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidites. The synthesized oligonucleotides may be annealed to one another as a complex, thereby producing a “synthetic” polynucleotide. Other methods for chemically synthesizing a polynucleotide are known in the art, and can be readily implemented for use in the present disclosure. The term “about” as used herein means greater or lesser than the value or range of values stated by 10 percent, but is not intended to designate any value or range of values to only this broader definition. Each value or range of values preceded by the term “about” is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values. For the purposes of the present disclosure, a “gene,” includes a DNA region encoding a gene product (see infra), as well as all DNA regions which regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites, introns and locus control regions. As used herein the terms “native” or “natural” define a condition found in nature. A “native DNA sequence” is a DNA sequence present in nature that was produced by natural means or traditional breeding techniques but not generated by genetic engineering (e.g., using molecular biology/transformation techniques). As used herein a “transgene” is defined to be a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product, including for example, but not, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In one embodiment the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an exogenous nucleic acid, where the transgene/heterologous coding sequence has been introduced into a host cell by genetic engineering (or the progeny thereof) where the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is not normally found. In one example, a transgene/heterologous coding sequence encodes an industrially or pharmaceutically useful compound, or a gene encoding a desirable agricultural trait (e.g., an herbicide-resistance gene). In yet another example, a transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an antisense nucleic acid sequence, wherein expression of the antisense nucleic acid sequence inhibits expression of a target nucleic acid sequence. In one embodiment the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an endogenous nucleic acid, wherein additional genomic copies of the endogenous nucleic acid are desired, or a nucleic acid that is in the antisense orientation with respect to the sequence of a target nucleic acid in a host organism. A “gene product” as defined herein is any product produced by the gene. For example, the gene product can be the direct transcriptional product of a gene (e.g., mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, antisense RNA, interfering RNA, ribozyme, structural RNA or any other type of RNA) or a protein produced by translation of a mRNA. Gene products also include RNAs which are modified, by processes such as capping, polyadenylation, methylation, and editing, and proteins modified by, for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, myristilation, and glycosylation. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals, for example, exposure of a cell, tissue, or organism to an agent that increases or decreases gene expression. Expression of a gene can also be regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation of gene expression occurs, for example, through controls acting on transcription, translation, RNA transport and processing, degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through activation, inactivation, compartmentalization, or degradation of specific protein molecules after they have been made, or by combinations thereof. Gene expression can be measured at the RNA level or the protein level by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, or in vitro, in situ, or in vivo protein activity assay(s). As used herein the term “gene expression” relates to the process by which the coded information of a nucleic acid transcriptional unit (including, e.g., genomic DNA) is converted into an operational, non-operational, or structural part of a cell, often including the synthesis of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals; for example, exposure of a cell, tissue, or organism to an agent that increases or decreases gene expression.

In particular embodiments, stringent conditions can include hybridization at 65° C., followed by washes at 65° C. with 0.1×SSC/0.1% SDS for 40 minutes. The following are representative, non-limiting hybridization conditions: Very High Stringency: Hybridization in 5×SSC buffer at 65° C. for 16 hours; was twice in 2×SSC buffer at room temperature for 15 minutes each; and wash twice in 0.5×SSC buffer at 65° C. for 20 minutes each. High Stringency: Hybridization in 5×-6×SSC buffer at 65-70° C. for 16-20 hours; wash twice in 2×SSC buffer at room temperature for 5-20 minutes each; and wash twice in 1×SSC buffer at 55-70° C. for 30 minutes each. Moderate Stringency: Hybridization in 6×SSC buffer at room temperature to 55° C. for 16-20 hours; wash at least twice in 2×-3×SSC buffer at room temperature to 55° C. for 20-30 minutes each. In particular embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under very high stringency hybridization conditions. In these and further embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under high stringency hybridization conditions. In these and further embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under moderate stringency hybridization conditions. As used herein, the term “oligonucleotide” refers to a short nucleic acid polymer. Oligonucleotides may be formed by cleavage of longer nucleic acid segments, or by polymerizing individual nucleotide precursors. Automated synthesizers allow the synthesis of oligonucleotides up to several hundred base pairs in length. Because oligonucleotides may bind to a complementary nucleotide sequence, they may be used as probes for detecting DNA or RNA. Oligonucleotides composed of DNA (oligodeoxyribonucleotides) may be used in PCR, a technique for the amplification of small DNA sequences. In PCR, the oligonucleotide is typically referred to as a “primer”, which allows a DNA polymerase to extend the oligonucleotide and replicate the complementary strand. The terms “percent sequence identity” or “percent identity” or “identity” are used interchangeably to refer to a sequence comparison based on identical matches between correspondingly identical positions in the sequences being compared between two or more amino acid or nucleotide sequences. The percent identity refers to the extent to which two optimally aligned polynucleotide or peptide sequences are invariant throughout a window of alignment of components, e.g., nucleotides or amino acids. Hybridization experiments and mathematical algorithms known in the art may be used to determine percent identity. Many mathematical, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,896 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textalgorithms exist as sequence alignment computer programs known in the art that calculate percent identity. These programs may be categorized as either global sequence alignment programs or local sequence alignment programs. Global sequence alignment programs calculate the percent identity of two sequences by comparing alignments end-to-end in order to find exact matches, dividing the number of exact matches by the length of the shorter sequences, and then multiplying by 100. Basically, the percentage of identical nucleotides in a linear polynucleotide sequence of a reference (“query) polynucleotide molecule as compared to a test (“subject”) polynucleotide molecule when the two sequences are optimally aligned (with appropriate nucleotide insertions, deletions, or gaps). Local sequence alignment programs are similar in their calculation, but only compare aligned fragments of the sequences rather than utilizing an end-to-end analysis. Local sequence alignment programs such as BLAST can be used to compare specific regions of two sequences. A BLAST comparison of two sequences results in an E-value, or expectation value, that represents the number of different alignments with scores equivalent to or better than the raw alignment score, S, that are expected to occur in a database search by chance. The lower the E value, the more significant the match. Because database size is an element in E-value calculations, E-values obtained by BLASTing against public databases, such as GENBANK, have generally increased over time for any given query/entry match. In setting criteria for confidence of polypeptide function prediction, a “high” BLAST match is considered herein as having an E-value for the top BLAST hit of less than 1E-30; a medium BLASTX E-value is 1E-30 to 1E-8; and a low BLASTX E-value is greater than 1E-8. The protein function assignment in the present disclosure is determined using combinations of E-values, percent identity, query coverage and hit coverage. Query coverage refers to the percent of the query sequence that is represented in the BLAST alignment. Hit coverage refers to the percent of the database entry that is represented in the BLAST alignment. In one embodiment of the disclosure, function of a query polypeptide is inferred from function of a conserved protein sequence where either (1) hit_p<1e-30 or % identity>35% AND query_coverage>50% AND hit_coverage>50%, or (2) hit_p<1e-8 AND query_coverage>70% AND hit_coverage>70%. Methods for aligning sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Various programs and alignment algorithms are described. In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using an AlignX alignment program of the Vector NTI suite (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The AlignX alignment program is a global sequence alignment program for polynucleotides or proteins.

In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the Clustal suite of alignment programs, including, but not limited to, ClustalW and ClustalV (Higgins and Sharp (1988) Gene. December 15; 73(1):237-44; Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS 5:151-3; Higgins et al. (1992) Comput. Appl. Biosci. 8:189-91). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the BLAST suite of alignment programs, for example, but not limited to, BLASTP, BLASTN, BLASTX, etc. (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10). Further examples of such BLAST alignment programs include Gapped-BLAST or PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the EMBOSS suite of alignment programs, including, but not limited to: Matcher, Needle, Stretcher, Water, Wordmatch, etc. (Rice, P., Longden, I. & Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite.  Trends in Genetics  Journal of Molecular Biology  Advances in Applied Mathematics,  The term “similarity” refers to a comparison between amino acid sequences, and takes into account not only identical amino acids in corresponding positions, but also functionally similar amino acids in corresponding positions. Thus similarity between polypeptide sequences indicates functional similarity, in addition to sequence similarity. The term “homology” is sometimes used to refer to the level of similarity between two or more nucleic acid or amino acid sequences in terms of percent of positional identity (i.e., sequence similarity or identity). Homology also refers to the concept of evolutionary relatedness, often evidenced by similar functional properties among different nucleic acids or proteins that share similar sequences. As used herein, the term “variants” means substantially similar sequences. For nucleotide sequences, naturally occurring variants can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, such as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined herein. For nucleotide sequences, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. As used herein, a “native” nucleotide sequence comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence.

Variant nucleotide sequences also include synthetically derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis. Generally, variants of a particular nucleotide sequence of the disclosure will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%>, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% o, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular nucleotide sequence as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. A biologically active variant of a nucleotide sequence of the disclosure may differ from that sequence by as few as 1-15 nucleic acid residues, as few as 1-10, such as 6-10, as few as 5, as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 nucleic acid residue. As used herein the term “operably linked” relates to a first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. When recombinantly produced, operably linked nucleic acid sequences are generally contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same reading frame. However, elements need not be contiguous to be operably linked. As used herein, the term “regeneration” means the process of growing a plant from a plant cell (e.g., plant protoplast or explant). As used herein, the term “culturing” refers to the in vitro propagation of cells or organisms on or in media of various kinds so that the maintenance or growth cell within a liquid culture medium are controlled under a set of physical conditions. It is understood that the descendants of a cell grown in culture may not be completely identical (i.e., morphologically, genetically, or phenotypically) to the parent cell. As used herein, the term “co-expressing” refers to two or more gene products which are produced at the same time within the same host organism. As used herein, the term “degenerate” refers to a primer or probe nucleic acid in which certain positions are not defined by a single, specific nucleotide. Thus, in such a degenerate position, the primer or probe sequence can be either one of at least two different nucleotides. Such positions often represent difference in genotypes of the target nucleic acid. A degenerate sequence may also be represented as a mixture of multiple non-degenerate individual sequences which, for the purpose of this disclosure, differ in at least two positions.

As used herein, the terms “cassette”, “expression cassette” and “gene expression cassette” refer to a segment of DNA that can be inserted into a nucleic acid or polynucleotide at specific restriction sites or by homologous recombination. As used herein the segment of DNA comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide of interest, and the cassette and restriction sites are designed to ensure insertion of the cassette in the proper reading frame for transcription and translation. In an embodiment, an expression cassette can include a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide of interest and having elements in addition to the polynucleotide that facilitate transformation of a particular host cell. In an embodiment, a gene expression cassette may also include elements that allow for enhanced expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of interest in a host cell. These elements may include, but are not limited to: a promoter, a minimal promoter, an enhancer, a response element, a terminator sequence, a polyadenylation sequence, and the like. As used herein a “linker” or “spacer” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers and spacers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups. The terms “polylinker” or “multiple cloning site” as used herein defines a cluster of three or more Type-2 restriction enzyme sites located within 10 nucleotides of one another on a nucleic acid sequence. In other instances the term “polylinker” as used herein refers to a stretch of nucleotides that are targeted for joining two sequences via any known seamless cloning method (i.e., Gibson Assembly®, NEBuilder HiFiDNA Assembly®, Golden Gate Assembly, BioBrick® Assembly, etc.). Constructs comprising a polylinker are utilized for the insertion and/or excision of nucleic acid sequences such as the coding region of a gene. As used herein, the term “control” refers to a sample used in an analytical procedure for comparison purposes. A control can be “positive” or “negative”. For example, where the purpose of an analytical procedure is to detect a differentially expressed transcript or polypeptide in cells or tissue, it is generally preferable to include a positive control, such as a sample from a known plant exhibiting the desired expression, and a negative control, such as a sample from a known plant lacking the desired expression. As used herein, the term “plant” includes a whole plant and any descendant, cell, tissue, or part of a plant. A class of plant that can be used in the present disclosure is generally as broad as the class of higher and lower plants amenable to mutagenesis including angiosperms (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants),, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The term “plant parts” include any part(s) of a plant, including, for example and without limitation: seed (including mature seed and immature seed); a plant cutting; a plant cell; a plant cell culture; a plant organ (e.g., pollen, embryos, flowers, fruits, shoots, leaves, roots, stems, and explants). A plant tissue or plant organ may be a seed, protoplast, callus, or any other group of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. A plant cell or tissue culture may be capable of regenerating a plant having the physiological and morphological characteristics of the plant from which the cell or tissue was obtained, and of regenerating a plant having substantially the same genotype as the plant. In contrast, some plant cells are not capable of being regenerated to produce plants. Regenerable cells in a plant cell or tissue culture may be embryos, protoplasts, meristematic cells, callus, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks. Plant parts include harvestable parts and parts useful for propagation of progeny plants. Plant parts useful for propagation include, for example and without limitation: seed; fruit; a cutting; a seedling; a tuber; and a rootstock. A harvestable part of a plant may be any useful part of a plant, including, for example and without limitation: flower; pollen; seedling; tuber; leaf; stem; fruit; seed; and root. A plant cell is the structural and physiological unit of the plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. A plant cell may be in the form of an isolated single cell, or an aggregate of cells (e.g., a friable callus and a cultured cell), and may be part of a higher organized unit (e.g., a plant tissue, plant organ, and plant). Thus, a plant cell may be a protoplast, a gamete producing cell, or a cell or collection of cells that can regenerate into a whole plant. As such, a seed, which comprises multiple plant cells and is capable of regenerating into a whole plant, is considered a “plant cell” in embodiments herein. As used herein, the term “linkage disequilibrium” refers to a statistical association between two loci or between a trait and a marker. As used herein, linkage between genes or markers refers to the phenomenon in which genes or markers on a chromosome show a measurable probability of being passed on together to individuals in the next generation. The closer two genes or markers are to each other, the closer to (1) this probability becomes. Thus, the term “linked.” may refer to one or more genes or markers that are passed together with a gene with a probability greater than 0.5 (which is expected from independent assortment where markers/genes are located on different chromosomes) Because the proximity of two genes or markers on a chromosome is directly related to the probability that the genes or markers will be passed together to, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the length of this marker will vary if nucleotides are added or subtracted from the span of genomic DNA located between the distal ends of the particular primers used when annealed. As used herein, the term “tightly linked” may refer to one or more genes or markers that are located within about 0.5 Mb of one another on the same chromosome. Thus, two “tightly linked” genes or markers may be separated by about 0.6 Mb; about 0.55 Mb; 0.5 Mb; about 0.45 Mb; about 0.4 Mb; about 0.35 Mb; about 0.3 Mb; about 0.25 Mb; about 0.2 Mb; about 0.15 Mb; about 0.12 Mb; about 0.1 Mb, about 0.05 Mb, and about 0.00 Mb. As used herein, the term “extremely tightly linked” may refer to one or more genes or markers that are located within about 100 kb of one another on the same chromosome. Thus, two “extremely tightly linked” genes or markers may be separated by about 125 kb; about 120 kb; about 115 kb; about 110 kb; about 105 kb; 100 kb; about 95 kb; about 90 kb; about 85 kb, about 80 kb; about 75 kb; about 70 kb; about 65 kb; about 60 kb, about 55 kb; about 50 kb; about 45 kb; about 40 kb; about 35 kb; about 30 kb; about 25 kb; about 20 kb; about 15 kb; about 12 kb; about 10 kb; about 5 kb; about 1 kb, and about 0 kb.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,918 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textregion or segment, the skilled person will understand that in order to achieve the introgression of only a part of a chromosome of one plant into the chromosome of another plant, it is required that random portions of the genomes of both parental lines will be recombined during the cross due to the occurrence of crossing-over events in the production of the gametes in the parent lines. Therefore, the genomes of both parents must be combined in a single cell by a cross, where after the production of gametes from said cell and their fusion in fertilization will result in an introgression event. The term “zygosity” means determining whether the source of nucleic acid appears heterozygous, homozygous, or hemizygous. As used herein, the term “heterozygous” means a genetic condition existing when different alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes. As used herein, the term “homozygous” means a genetic condition existing when identical alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes. As used herein, the term “hemizygous” means having an allele of a gene at a given locus on one chromosome in the diploid state, for which there is no corresponding locus on the other chromosome of the pair. As used herein, the term “introgression” refers to a genomic segment that has moved from one individual, species, variety or cultivar into the genome of another individual, species, variety or cultivar, by crossing those individuals, species, varieties or cultivars. As used herein, the terms “introgressing”, “introgress” and “introgressed” refer to both a natural and artificial process whereby individual genes or entire traits are moved from one individual, species, variety or cultivar into the genome of another species, variety or cultivar, by crossing those species, varieties or cultivars. In plant breeding, the process usually involves selfing or backcrossing to the recurrent parent to provide for an increasingly homozygous plant having essentially the characteristics of the recurrent parent in addition to the introgressed gene or trait. The term “backcross” refers to the process wherein the plant resulting from a cross between two parental lines is crossed with one of its parental lines, wherein the parental line used in the backcross is referred to as the recurrent parent. Repeated backcrossing results in the genome becoming more and more homozygous or inbred. The term “selfing” refers to the process of self-fertilization wherein an individual is pollinated or fertilized with its own pollen. Unless otherwise specifically explained, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.

Molecular Confirmation Methods of confirming the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in  B. napus  B. napus  Molecular Beacons have been described for use in sequence detection. Briefly, a FRET oligonucleotide probe is designed that overlaps the flanking genomic and insert DNA junction. The unique structure of the FRET probe results in it containing a secondary structure that keeps the fluorescent and quenching moieties in close proximity. The FRET probe and PCR primers (one primer in the insert DNA sequence and one in the flanking genomic sequence) are cycled in the presence of a thermostable polymerase and dNTPs. Following successful PCR amplification, hybridization of the FRET probe(s) to the target sequence results in the removal of the probe secondary structure and spatial separation of the fluorescent and quenching moieties. A fluorescent signal indicates the presence of the flanking genomic/transgene insert sequence due to successful amplification and hybridization. Such a molecular beacon assay for detection of as an amplification reaction is an embodiment of the subject disclosure. Hydrolysis probe assay, otherwise known as TAQMAN® (Life Technologies, Foster City, Calif.), is a method of detecting and quantifying the presence of a DNA sequence. Briefly, a FRET oligonucleotide probe is designed with one oligo within the transgene and one in the flanking genomic sequence for event-specific detection. The FRET probe and PCR primers (one primer in the insert DNA sequence and one in the flanking genomic sequence) are cycled in the presence of a thermostable polymerase and dNTPs. Hybridization of the FRET probe results in cleavage and release of the fluorescent moiety away from the quenching moiety on the FRET probe. A fluorescent signal indicates the presence of the flanking/transgene insert sequence due to successful amplification and hybridization. Such a hydrolysis probe assay for detection of as an amplification reaction is an embodiment of the subject disclosure. KASPar® assays are a method of detecting and quantifying the presence of a DNA sequence.

The forward primer contains a sequence corresponding to a specific region of the DNA polynucleotide, and the reverse primer contains a sequence corresponding to a specific region of the genomic sequence. In addition, the primers used in the PCR assay mixture can comprise at least one forward primers and at least one reverse primer. For example, the KASPar® PCR assay mixture can use two forward primers corresponding to two different alleles and one reverse primer. One of the forward primers contains a sequence corresponding to specific region of the endogenous genomic sequence. The second forward primer contains a sequence corresponding to a specific region of the DNA polynucleotide.

In other embodiments the amplification reaction is run using suitable second fluorescent DNA dyes that are capable of staining cellular DNA at a concentration range detectable by flow cytometry, and have a fluorescent emission spectrum which is detectable by a real time thermocycler. It should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that other nucleic acid dyes are known and are continually being identified. Any suitable nucleic acid dye with appropriate excitation and emission spectra can be employed, such as YO-PRO-1®, SYTOX Green®, SYBR Green I®, SYTO11®, SYTO12®, SYTO13®, BOBO®, YOYO®, and TOTO®. In further embodiments, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be used for detection. As described by Brautigma et al., 2010, DNA sequence analysis can be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the isolated and amplified fragment. The amplified fragments can be isolated and sub-cloned into a vector and sequenced using chain-terminator method (also referred to as Sanger sequencing) or Dye-terminator sequencing. In addition, the amplicon can be sequenced with Next Generation Sequencing. NGS technologies do not require the sub-cloning step, and multiple sequencing reads can be completed in a single reaction. Three NGS platforms are commercially available, the Genome Sequencer FLX™ from 454 Life Sciences/Roche, the Illumina Genome Analyser™ from Solexa and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD™ (acronym for: ‘Sequencing by Oligo Ligation and Detection’).

2023-07-05 15:08:36,956 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, an offensive odor-suppressing composition for reducing the offensiveness of age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, as well as a flavor composition for reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products. BACKGROUND ART Ambient odors and offensive odors perceived as unpleasant in daily life are strongly desired to be eliminated more effectively for improved living environments. In recent years, there has been growing awareness of body odors, among others. Further, food and beverage products are known to produce off-odors (off-flavors) over time, which in turn reduce the quality of the food and beverage products. Body odors are broadly divided into two categories, i.e., the “smell of each body part” (e.g., mouth odor, foot odor, underarm odor, scalp odor) and the “combined smell arising from the body trunk.” The “combined smell arising from the body trunk” is known to change with age, and age-related body odors, which are observed at middle age or later, very strongly tend to be disfavored. As to substances responsible for causing such age-related body odors, unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-2-nonenal and trans-2-octenal have been reported to cause age-related body odors (Patent Literature 1). Moreover, vinyl ketones such as 1-octen-3-one and 1,5-octadien-3-one have a very low odor threshold and a strong metallic odor, and are reported to be greatly involved in underarm odors (Non-patent Literature 1). Moreover, nonenal, 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one and so on are also known as off-flavors (Patent Literatures 2 and 3, Non-patent Literature 2). Selective odor elimination techniques based on antagonistic mechanism are designed to search for olfactory receptors responding to particular odorous substances and to suppress their activation with particular substances, and the potential of these techniques is becoming clear. For example, olfactory receptor OR2W1 responds to hexanoic acid, which is among offensive odors. Substances inhibiting the activity of this OR2W1 are exemplified by florhydral, and florhydral has been reported to suppress an offensive odor induced by hexanoic acid in sensory testing (Patent Literature 4).

However, such olfactory receptors responding to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol have not been widely known so far. Under these circumstances, there has been a desire to search for olfactory receptors responding to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol, and thereby provide a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, and also provide an offensive odor-suppressing composition for reducing the offensiveness of age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, as well as a flavor composition for reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products. Solution to Problem As a result of extensive and intensive efforts made to solve the problems stated above, the inventors of the present invention have succeeded in newly identifying olfactory receptors responding respectively to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol. The inventors of the present invention have made further studies and have found that the use of these olfactory receptors enables the evaluation and selection of materials suppressing age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, and materials reducing off-flavors, as well as materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, by means of the masking effect of olfactory receptor antagonists. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that antagonist candidate compounds suppressing the response of these olfactory receptors including OR2C1 and OR4Q3 are excellent not only in the effect of suppressing age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, but also in the effect of reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products. Namely, the present invention provides a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

 Advantageous Effects of Invention The method of the present invention allows screening for candidate substances for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor. The screening method of the present invention can be expected to contribute to the development of materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor. Moreover, when attempting to develop new fragrance or flavor materials, there are problems of olfactory fatigue and variations among individuals if many candidate substances are evaluated for their odor by the human olfactory sense alone; and hence the proper selection of candidate substances may involve difficulties. According to the method of the present invention, such problems can be overcome or reduced. Further, according to a preferred aspect of the present invention, when a group of antagonist candidate compounds suppressing the response of OR2C1 and/or OR4Q3 are used in combination with a group of particular compounds conventionally used as fragrances or flavorings, etc., a greater suppressive effect may be provided on offensive odors than when the group of antagonist candidate compounds are used alone., Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Screening Method for 1-Octen-3-One Odor-Suppressing Materials The screening method for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials according to the present invention is designed such that test substances are screened with olfactory receptor polypeptides responsive to 1-octen-3-one to select candidate substances for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. This method is characterized by comprising the following steps: adding a test substance and 1-octen-3-one to at least one olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of (a) OR2C1 and OR4Q3, and (b) polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of at least 80% with the amino acid sequence of any of the polypeptides in (a) and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one; measuring the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one; and identifying a test substance that suppresses the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide on the basis of the measured response, i.e., identifying a test substance that suppresses the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide on the basis of the measured response as a candidate substance for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the screening method for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials according to the present invention comprises the following steps: (i) bringing an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of (a) OR2C1 and OR4Q3, and (b) polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more with the amino acid sequence of any of the polypeptides in (a) and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one into contact with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one;, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In the screening method for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials according to the present invention, the term “test substance” is not limited in any way, but it refers to a subject to be tested for its suppressive effect on a 1-octen-3-one odor and is intended to mean a compound, a composition or a mixture. Likewise, the term “1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing material” is not limited in any way, but it is intended to mean a compound, a composition or a mixture, which is capable of suppressing a 1-octen-3-one odor. Moreover, the term “1-octen-3-one odor” is intended to mean an odor originating from 1-octen-3-one, as exemplified by a mushroom odor, an iron rust odor, an underarm odor, off-flavors, etc. An explanation will be given below of each step. <Step (i)> In step (i), an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of OR2C1, OR4Q3, and polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more with the amino acid sequence of any of these polypeptides and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one is brought into contact with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one. The olfactory receptor polypeptide to be used for this purpose is an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of OR2C1, OR4Q3, and polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more with the amino acid sequence of any of these polypeptides and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one. OR2C1 has been registered in GenBank under NM_012368, and is a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) encoded by DNA at positions 53 to 991 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. OR4Q3 has been registered in GenBank under NM_172194, and is a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 4) encoded by DNA having the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3. Since these polypeptides strongly and selectively respond to 1-octen-3-one, the screening method using OR2C1 and/or OR4Q3 can be expected to contribute to the development of 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. As an olfactory receptor, it is also possible to use an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Such olfactory receptor polypeptides may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination. In the present invention, there is no particular limitation on how to contact an olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one. For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-one on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-one on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. The time required to contact the olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1-octen-3-one is not determined exactly because it also depends on the concentration of 1-octen-3-one and the method used for measurement. However, the response may be measured immediately after their contact, and the time required for their contact is usually 0 to 4 hours, and preferably 2 to 4 hours. The same goes for when the olfactory receptor polypeptide is contacted with 1-octen-3-one in admixture with a test substance. Cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be prepared when cells are transformed with a vector carrying a gene encoding the olfactory receptor polypeptide. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin may be integrated together with the olfactory receptor polypeptide. Upon integration of the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin, cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be facilitated. Bovine rhodopsin has been registered in GenBank under NM_001014890. Bovine rhodopsin is a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) encoded by DNA at positions 1 to 1047 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5. Moreover, instead of bovine rhodopsin, it is also possible to use a polypeptide which comprises an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, even more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 98% or more with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 and which is capable of facilitating cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide. It should be noted that amino acid residues of not only bovine rhodopsin but also any other polypeptides may be used as long as they can facilitate cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide. There is no particular limitation on how to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide, and any, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

For example, it is known that once an odorous compound has bound to an olfactory receptor polypeptide, G protein in cells will be activated and this G protein will in turn activate adenylate cyclase to convert ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), thereby increasing the intracellular level of cAMP. Thus, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide can be measured when the level of cAMP is measured. The level of cAMP may be measured using ELISA techniques, reporter gene assay techniques, etc. Above all, it is preferred that the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase). According to one embodiment of the present invention, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be evaluated on the basis of the fold increase value determined by dividing the results measured in the presence of 1-octen-3-one by the results measured in the absence of 1-octen-3-one. For example, when the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase), evaluation can be made using 1-octen-3-one at a concentration which gives a fold increase value of preferably 2 or more, more preferably 4 or more, and even more preferably 10 or more. <Step (ii)> In step (ii), a test substance is mixed with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor used in step (i). The response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured in the same manner as shown in step (i), except that 1-octen-3-one is mixed with the test substance and contacted with the olfactory receptor polypeptide. For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. For proper comparison of the results measured in steps (i) and (ii), the measurement conditions in steps (i) and (ii) are preferably the same, except for the presence or absence of the test substance. <Step (iii)> In step (iii), the results measured in steps (i) and (ii) are compared with each other to select a test substance causing a reduction in the response as a candidate substance for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. In the present invention, when a reduction in the response is observed as a result of comparing the results measured in steps (i) and (ii), the test substance used in step (ii) can be evaluated as a candidate substance for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. In such a way as described above, test substances can be screened to select candidate substances for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials.

Further, the selected substances may be blended with other fragrance or flavor materials to thereby develop fragrance or flavor materials capable of suppressing the 1-octen-3-one odor and also having the most suitable scent. The screening method of the present invention can be used to contribute to the development of new fragrance or flavor materials serving as 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. 2.

This method is characterized by comprising the following steps: adding a test substance and 1,5-octadien-3-one to at least one olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of (a) OR2C1 and OR4Q3, and (b) polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of at least 80% with the amino acid sequence of any of the polypeptides in (a) and which are responsive to 1,5-octadien-3-one; measuring the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1,5-octadien-3-one; and identifying a test substance that suppresses the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide on the basis of the measured response, i.e., identifying a test substance that suppresses the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide on the basis of the measured response as a candidate substance for 1,5-octadien-3-one odor-suppressing materials.

Such olfactory receptor polypeptides may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination. In the present invention, there is no particular limitation on how to contact an olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1,5-octadien-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1,5-octadien-3-one. For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1,5-octadien-3-one on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1,5-octadien-3-one on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. The time required to contact the olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1,5-octadien-3-one is not determined exactly because it also depends on the concentration of 1,5-octadien-3-one and the method used for measurement. However, the response may be measured immediately after their contact, and the time required for their contact is usually 0 to 4 hours, and preferably 2 to 4 hours. The same goes for when the olfactory receptor polypeptide is contacted with 1,5-octadien-3-one in admixture with a test substance. Cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be prepared when cells are transformed with a vector carrying a gene encoding the olfactory receptor polypeptide. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin may be integrated together with the olfactory receptor polypeptide. Upon integration of the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin, cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be facilitated. Bovine rhodopsin has been registered in GenBank under NM_001014890. Bovine rhodopsin is a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) encoded by DNA at positions 1 to 1047 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5. Moreover, instead of bovine rhodopsin, it is also possible to use a polypeptide which comprises an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, even more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 98% or more with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 and which is capable of facilitating cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide.

For example, it is known that once an odorous compound has bound to an olfactory receptor polypeptide, G protein in cells will be activated and this G protein will in turn activate adenylate cyclase to convert ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), thereby increasing the intracellular level of cAMP. Thus, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide can be measured when the level of cAMP is measured. The level of cAMP may be measured using ELISA techniques, reporter gene assay techniques, etc. Above all, it is preferred that the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase). According to one embodiment of the present invention, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be evaluated on the basis of the fold increase value determined by dividing the results measured in the presence of 1,5-octadien-3-one by the results measured in the absence of 1,5-octadien-3-one. For example, when the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase), evaluation can be made using 1,5-octadien-3-one at a concentration which gives a fold increase value of preferably 2 or more, more preferably 4 or more, and even more preferably 10 or more. <Step (ii)> In step (ii), a test substance is mixed with 1,5-octadien-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor used in step (i). The response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured in the same manner as shown in step (i), except that 1,5-octadien-3-one is mixed with the test substance and contacted with the olfactory receptor polypeptide. For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. For proper comparison of the results measured in steps (i) and (ii), the measurement conditions in steps (i) and (ii) are preferably the same, except for the presence or absence of the test substance. <Step (iii)> In step (iii), the results measured in steps (i) and (ii) are compared with each other to select a test substance causing a reduction in the response as a candidate substance for 1,5-octadien-3-one odor-suppressing materials.

2023-07-05 15:08:36,986 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textgeometrical configuration, materials, and the surrounding dielectric permittivity. Any modification to these parameters induces a resonance shift, however without any selectivity. That means two similar biomolecules when attached to the metallic interface impart same resonance shifts, making them indistinguishable. Hence, it is essential to incorporate an affinity layer against the target biomarker to produce a selective LSPR shift upon analyte binding to enable label-free affinity-based plasmonic biosensing. The plasmonic sensor is formed by hybridizing the LSP with an asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity resonator 17,19,28 FIG.  1 29 FIG.  1 260 265 FIGS.  1 1 19 FIG.  1 275 270 FIG.  1 Target Specific Viral Genome Detection Nonstructural NS1 glycoprotein forms part of the genetic code of all the Flaviviridae virus family, such as the four serotypes of the DENV, the Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne Encephalitis virus, and Zika virus 30-32 FIG.  1 32 32,33 34,35 11,27 To target specific detection, the sensor is functionalized with ssDNA aptamer to detect NS1 protein directly from blood. However, detection from minimally processed and unfiltered biological samples in general is challenging due to the protein adsorption on sensor surface. The high protein content in blood plasma tends to electrostatically accumulate on the negatively charged gold surface producing a spurious biofilm accumulation leading to an uncontrolled background masking the positive binding of the target biomarker. In order to address such a protein fouling, the present disclosure implements a surface passivation based on thiol-terminated MCH self-assembled monolayer, which is a typical surface passivating strategy for gold-based biosensors 21,36,37 280 FIG.  1 FIG.  1 FIG.  1 FIG.  1 FIG.  1 290 FIG.  2 Two non-functionalized plasmonic substrates were prepared with and without surface passivation. This PBS+BSA solution was flowed using a microfluidic chip placed on top of the plasmonic substrate and secured with an acrylic fixture. First, the PBS flows in the microfluidic channel to bring the sensor to a stable state determining the baseline. Then, the PBS+BSA solution flows for five minutes and then flushed away with PBS to remove poorly adhered BSA on the gold surface. Protein adsorption and selective biding in the subsequent biosensing demonstrations, is gauged using the LSPR shift with respect to the baseline. In the plasmonic substrate without passivation, BSA accumulates rapidly within half a minute and remain constant independent of the continuous BSA flow, which is a sign of surface saturation. The flow of PBS solution flushes any poorly adhered BSA, but the residual LSPR shift (0.497±0.028 nm) denotes a considerable remaining protein adhesion to the substrate, see diagram  300 FIG.  2 FIG.  2 310 Detection in PBS The first detection demonstration is performed in PBS solution where purified DENV2-NS1 protein was spiked at, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/213,110 is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. FIELD Disclosed are methods and systems for the detection of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that cause COVID-19 and the geographic location of individuals infected with any strain of the variants. INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae, genus Beta coronavirus. All coronaviruses share similarities in the organization and expression of their genome, which encodes 16 nonstructural. proteins and the 4 structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Viruses of this family are of zoonotic origin. They cause disease with symptoms ranging from those of a mild common cold to more severe ones such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MFRS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Other coronaviruses known to infect people include 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1, The latter are ubiquitous and infection typically causes common cold or flu-like symptoms. The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta-coronavirus that first emerged as a pathogen with outbreak potential in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Initial reports suggested that limited person to person transmission occurred within China. However, in early 2020, additional cases of 2019-nCoV have been detected worldwide, indicating sustained person to person transmission. To date, the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 has ranged from mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections to more serious lower respiratory tract illness leading to significant morbidity and mortality. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has accelerated, more keen attention has been paid to diversity of viral genomic sequences, and how these variants may affect transmissibility of infection, severity of infection, or viral escape from natural or vaccine-induced immunity. Viruses constantly change through mutation. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the U.S. and globally. Some variants may emerge and disappear; other variants may persist and display increased infectivity or severity of symptoms. For example, as of June 2021 there were six notable variants in the United States. (1) B.1.1.7: this variant was first detected in the United States in December 2020. It was initially detected in the United Kingdom. (2) B.1.351: this variant was first detected in the United States at the end of January 2021 and was initially detected in South Africa in December 2020. (3) P.1: this variant was first detected in the United States in January 2021—P.1 was initially identified in travelers from Brazil, who were tested during routine screening at an airport in Japan, in early January. (4) B.1.427 and (5) B.1.429: these two variants, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Thus, there is a need to identify and track new variants. There is further a need to track the geographic location of infected individuals to assist public health authorities in responding to the pandemic. SUMMARY Disclosed are methods and systems for identifying and tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2 that can cause COVID-19. The methods and systems may be embodied in a variety of ways. In certain embodiments, the method may comprise a method for identifying and/or tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2 comprising the steps of: (a) identifying a sample from a subject as positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; (b) generating a sample-specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from the sample; (c) performing nucleic acid sequencing on the sample-specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid; and (d) determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequence. In an embodiment, sequencing covers the majority of the viral genome. Thus, in certain embodiments, where the sample SARS-CoV-2 genome is amplified by RT-PCR, the resulting cDNA is then further amplified using tiled primers that bind at spaced intervals along the viral genome. In certain embodiments, the tiled primers are spaced such that adjacent primers are 600 bp apart from each other. In this way, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is amplified in a highly efficient manner regardless of the presence or absence of new variants. For example, in certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequencing comprises sequencing at least 80%, or optionally at least 85%, or optionally at least 90%, or optionally at least 95% of the entire viral genome. The amplified nucleic acid molecules may be labeled with molecular barcode identifying sequences. For example, in certain embodiments, the tiled primers are primers further comprise an adaptor for the addition of a barcode sequence and/or universal primer sites for nucleic acid sequencing. Also disclosed are systems for performing any of the steps of the disclosed method steps as well as a computer-program product tangibly embodied in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, including instructions configured to run any of the stations and/or components of the system and/or perform a step or steps of the methods of any of the disclosed embodiments. Also disclosed are systems that include one or more data processors and a non-transitory computer readable storage medium containing instructions which, when executed on the one or more data processors, cause the one or more data processors to perform part or all of one or more methods disclosed herein, and computer program products tangibly embodied in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, and that include instructions configured to cause one or more data, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The term “blood” encompasses whole blood, blood product or any fraction of blood, such as serum, plasma, buffy coat, or the like as conventionally defined. As used herein, the term subject or individual refers to a human or any non-human animal. A subject or individual can be a patient, which refers to a human presenting to a medical provider for diagnosis or treatment of a disease, and in some cases, wherein the disease may be any infection by a pathogen. Also, as used herein, the terms “individual,” “subject” or “patient” includes all warm-blooded animals. As used herein SMRT refers to single-molecule real-time sequencing that uses a zero-mode waveguide (ZMW). A single DNA polymerase enzyme is affixed at the bottom of a ZMW with a single molecule of DNA as a template. The ZMW creates an illuminated observation volume that is small enough to observe only a single nucleotide being incorporated. Each of the four DNA bases is attached to one of four different fluorescent dyes. When a nucleotide is incorporated by the DNA polymerase, the fluorescent tag is cleaved off and diffuses out of the observation area of the ZMW where its fluorescence is no longer observable. A detector detects the fluorescent signal of the nucleotide incorporation, and the base call is made according to the corresponding fluorescence of the dye. As used herein, CT or ct refers to cycle threshold, or the total number of cycles required to amplify and detect a viral (e.g., SARS-CoV-3) nucleic acid by RT-PCR. As used herein loci loop capture is the process of using molecular inversion probes to bind to and amplify a region of interest within the viral genome. As used herein, CCS or circular consensus sequencing reads are processed reads that have been corrected for errors in raw sequencing data by sequencing the length of a captured DNA fragment multiple times. As used herein, repeatability (or intra-assay precision) describes the closeness of agreement between results of successive measurements of the same analyte and carried out under the same conditions of measurement. Intra-assay repeatability is the measurement of the variability when the same specimen is, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:36,996 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textanalyzed during one analytical run. As used herein reproducibility (or inter-assay precision) describes the closeness of agreement between results of successive measurements of the same analyte and carried out under the same conditions of measurement. Inter-assay repeatability is a measurement of the variability when the same specimen is analyzed during more than one run. As used herein, concordance measures the closeness of agreement between the measured value and the value that is accepted as a conventional true or accepted reference value. This can require a “gold standard” or an accepted method to which a new method can be compared. As used herein, analytical validity requires establishing the probability that a test will be positive when a particular sequence (analyte) is present (analytical sensitivity) and the probability that the test will be negative when the sequence is absent (analytical specificity). In next generation sequencing (NGS), analytical sensitivity can be the likelihood that the assay will detect the targeted sequence variations, if present nucleic acid sequences derived from the assay and a reference sequence. For NGS, analytical specificity is defined as the probability that the assay will not detect a sequence variation when none are present (the false detection rate is a useful measurement for sequencing assays). As used herein, specificity defines the ability of a measurement procedure to measure solely the analyte. As used herein, the assay tolerance for nucleic acid input is the tolerance to variation in the amount of analyte added to the reactions. As used herein, GISAID is a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open access to genomic data of influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19) data. The database has become the world's largest repository for SARS-CoV-2 sequences. GISAID facilitates genomic epidemiology and real-time surveillance to monitor the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains. As used herein, when an action is “based on” something, this means the action is based at least in part on at least a part of the something. Methods for NGS SARS-CoV-2 Strain Determination Disclosed are methods and systems for identifying and tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2 that can cause COVID-19. The methods and systems may be embodied in a variety of ways. In certain embodiments, the method may comprise a method for identifying and/or tracking variants of SARS-CoV-2 comprising the steps of: (a) identifying a sample from a subject as positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; (b) generating a sample-specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from the sample; (c) performing nucleic acid sequencing on the sample-specific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid; and (d) determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequence. The method may utilize samples for which the COVID status is not known, or may use samples that have previously tested positive for, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The probes may be tiled over and/or to provide a sequence on average for a given nucleotide 2X, 7X, 22X or more. Also, in certain embodiments, the single-stranded probe DNA template further comprises universal sequencing primers (e.g., M13 primers) positioned adjacent to the probe sequences. These can allow for enrichment with matching universal primer sequences and unique sample specific barcoding for downstream bioinformatic analysis. Additionally, in certain embodiments, and as disclosed in more detail herein, the single-stranded probe DNA template further comprises an adaptor sequence for the addition of a barcode sequence used to correlate the SARS-CoV-2 sample-specific nucleic acid to a sample number. In some cases, the barcode may be correlated to the zip code from which the sample and/or patient originated. Also, the method may include filling in the sequence between the two probes to generate a circular single-stranded probe DNA template comprising sequence specific to the sample SARS-CoV-2 cDNA between the two probe sequences and then releasing the circular single-stranded probe DNA template comprising sequence specific to the sample SARS-CoV-2 cDNA from the sample-specific SARS-CoV-2 DNA and digestion of the circular single-stranded probe DNA template comprising sequence specific to the sample SARS-CoV-2 cDNA to generate a linear DNA used as a template for nucleic acid sequencing. In certain embodiments, the linear probe DNA template is then modified to add adaptors and then PCR amplified (enriched) for DNA sequencing. In certain embodiments, the step of enrichment comprises a purification step (e.g., bead purification). For example, in certain embodiments, the substrate for sequencing is generated by RT-PCR and then SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified using ˜1000 tiled Molecular Loop Inversion Probes (MIPS) designed to amplify RNA that has been reverse transcribed to cDNA from 99.6% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with most bases covered by 22 MIPs. In certain embodiments, the product synthesized in-between the MIPS is enriched and has sample specific molecular barcodes added via amplification followed by sequencing. In certain embodiments, the method employs whole genome sequencing. In certain embodiments, next generation sequencing (NGS) is used. Or, other types of sequencing such as but not limited to Sanger sequencing, shot gun sequencing, SMRT sequencing, pyrosequencing or nanopore sequencing may be used. For example, in certain embodiments the PacBio whole genome sequencing with the corresponding SMRT link 9 software and analysis tools may be used. For example, in one embodiment, the method may employ a PacBio whole genome sequencing test for SARS-CoV-2 strain identification using residual total nucleic acid extracts from positive samples. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequencing comprises sequencing at least 80%, or optionally 85%, or optionally 90% or greater of the entire viral genome.

Additionally, the method may comprise assessing the lineage for the sample. In certain embodiments, the method may include identifying the geographic location of the subject. Additionally, as disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, the method may include uploading the results of the step of determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequence into a depository for further classification (e.g., lineage determination) if a variant is detected. The depository may be a CDC database. Or, other public depositories may be used. The method may further include determining if an update to the depository has been made prior to the step of determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a SARS-CoV-2 variant sequence. The method may be automated at various steps in the procedure. In certain embodiments, the method may be used with Hamilton Star robots for sample plate setup. Additionally, and/or alternatively, Formulatrix Mantis Liquid Handlers or other automated devices may be used for mastermix distribution. Also, as disclosed herein the method may be computer implemented and/or include use of a computer-program product tangibly embodied in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, including instructions configured to perform any of the steps of the method. For example, in certain embodiments, residual total nucleic acid extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR diagnostic testing samples with Ct values <31 are cherry picked, e.g., as disclosed in more detail herein, from RNA extraction plates into a 96 well plate containing only positive samples using Hamilton STARs. Samples may then be aliquoted into a sequencing run plate of 95 samples with one water non-template control (NTC). The method may be scaled as required. For example, in certain embodiments, eight plates, or 760 specimens, may be processed in one production batch.

In certain embodiments, after sequencing and NTC analysis the mean of medium CCS reads may be computationally analyzed for passing acceptance criteria of 10 CCS reads  310 At this point, lineages for individual samples may then be assigned using the consensus sequence  312 314 In certain embodiments, assessment of the strain determination results are performed after NTC analysis and removal of any samples on a plate with a failed NTC. Individual sample results are then computationally investigated for mean of median CCS reads >10 CCS and percent genome coverage is >90%. In certain embodiments, test results may be reported to healthcare providers and relevant public health authorities in accordance with local, state, and federal requirements. In certain embodiments, samples not meeting these criteria fail analysis and strain typing is not reported. Additionally and/or alternatively, when only positive samples are tested, the method is not used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection status where infection status is not dictated by viral whole genome sequencing results. Data Analysis The analysis of the sequence data may, in certain embodiments, comprise a pre-processing (i.e., upstream) steps and post-processing (i.e., downstream) steps. In certain embodiments, at least some of these steps comprise computer-implemented steps for data analysis. The upstream analysis may comprise monitoring the sequencer runs for completion, demultiplexing to generate individual sample FASTQ files, and triggering the alignment of each to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome to generate alignments and variant call. The downstream analysis for samples in each SMRTCell may be comprised of generating all the results including the lineage classifications for each sample.

Example 1 Overall Method and Analysis of Results Using next generation sequencing (NGS), surveillance testing can be performed on large numbers of samples and to generate an adequate number of viral genomes to track mutations and variants of concern as they arise. The overall test principle is as follows. First, cDNA is prepared from viral RNA using random priming for first strand synthesis. Next, inversion probes are annealed to target during a 16-hour hybridization. Next, gaps are filled in via polymerization and ligation. Next, non-reacted linear probes are removed and probe is released from, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,015 - WARNING - An error occurred: input texttarget DNA. Next, captured target is enriched by PCR amplification using asymmetric barcodes. Next, PCR products are pooled, quantified, and SMRTbell hairpin adapters are ligated to amplicons and sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences Sequel II using a 15 hr movie. At this point, lineage calls are made based on processing of the NGS sequence data. For this analysis, every condensed positive ‘cherry picked’ (discussed in more detail herein) includes: No Template Control (NTC) (i.e., molecular grade water) in well Al of the 96-well condensed positive plate. NTC results are reviewed prior to generation of the result file for a given SMRTcell. If an NTC is found to be invalid, results for all patient samples on the affected plate are not reported. Upon completion of processing of the NGS results for a given sequence cell, a result file is generated and saved. At this point, PacBio SMRTLNK software and custom molecular loop processing scripts are used to generate the FASTQ files for each of the samples. FASTQ results are analyzed using a genome analysis pipeline implemented in CLC genomics server version 6.5.6. This workflow starts with a sample-level fastq file, trims the primers and then uses Minimap2 to align to the SARS-COVID19 reference genome (“NC_045512v2”) to generate a bam file of alignment. After coverage checking, the bam file is used as the input for calling variants and for generating a sample-specific genome assembly. A consensus sequence for each sample is generated using “VCFcons” requiring a coverage of 4 CCS reads and alternate allele frequency of 50% at each base. The lineages for individual samples are assigned using the Pangolin package. Example 2 Methods and Validation for VirSeq SARS-CoV-2 NGS Strain Determination Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can determine the specific strain of SARS-CoV-2. The strain information can potentially provide valuable information to clinicians and epidemiologist to aid in the public health response to the virus or future clinical treatments. The determination of a given strain is based on a combination of multiple variations in the genome detected from comparison of DNA sequencing results to the original Wuhan reference strain. This approach allows the identification of any new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 as the virus changes over time without revalidation. The intended use of this assay is to result SARS-CoV-2 lineage, or strain, calls with samples that yield at least 90% genome coverage. The overall test principle is as follows. Residual total nucleic acid extract from residual SARS-CoV-2 NAA diagnostic testing positive samples was cherry picked from run plates into a condensed positive plate using Hamilton STARs, and aliquoted into a sequencing run plate of 96, with 8 plates or 768 specimens in one production batch.

The CLC Analysis workflow was performed using the following steps: (1) An NGS data analysis workflow is executed on each sample using a current validated CLC Genomics Server version; (2) For each sample's FASTQ file: (a) reads were filtered to retain reads of 250-5000 bp length; (b) reads were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (“NC_045512v2”) using minimap2 to generate a BAM file; (c) local realignment was performed and variant calls made using the Low Frequency Variant Detection tool in CLC Genomics Server; and (d) both the assembly (BAM file) and detected variants (cf) were input into a downstream post-processing analysis. A script detected CLC process completion, initiating the launch of downstream analysis for samples in each SMRTcell. Downstream Analysis An example flow-chart for downstream (post-processing) analysis is shown in  FIG.  5 FIG.  5 At this point post-processing part 2 was initiated as shown for the “Combine Patient Metadata”, “Quality checking”, and “Generate final report” blocks in  FIG.  5 The lineage calling criteria were as follows. Inclusion criteria: (1) CT <31; (2) corresponding metadata (strain surveillance); (3) >90% genome coverage; (4) mean of median coverage >10 CCS reads; (4) passing NTC control; and (5) Nextclade result and Pangolin lineage call. Exclusion criteria: (1) CT >31; (2) missing metadata (strain surveillance); (3) <90% genome coverage; (4) mean of median coverage <10 CCS reads; and (4) failing NTC control. Example 5 Assessment of Potential New Variants and Classification Revalidating the classification accuracy of the Virseq assay in response to the emergence of new variants (i.e. lineages) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concomitant changes to the pangolin classification software was performed as outlined in  FIG.  6 If there were updates, a regression analysis was performed using in-house laboratory data. Essentially the steps were performed as follows. The new pangolin version was used to determine the lineage of samples contained within the reference set of historical Virseq sequences. The reference set included an initial SMRT cell from October 2021, predominantly composed of Delta lineages. It also contained two updates of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,044 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textOmicron lineages made in December 2021 and March 2022. Each sample in the reference set included its consensus sequence as well as the history of its lineage classifications made by previous pangolin versions. The reference set was updated periodically to include samples representing newer, more prevalent lineages as pangolin versions are updated. Next, the format of the pangolin software output was compared with that of the previous version to determine if there are changes in the pangolin output format. If there were any changes to the CSV output (i.e. additional columns, changes in column names), these were documented and the laboratory Virseq pipeline modified as needed to accommodate the change. The modified version was then deployed to the QA environment for testing. Next, any changes in lineage calls were assessed and compared with those expected from the software update change notes. Expected changes typically include reassignment among sublineages. If there were any unexpected changes in lineages (e.g. Delta sublineage to Alpha), these were investigated in detail and documented. The acceptance criteria and action taken were as follows. Lineage classification disagreements are mostly due to the improvement of pangoLEARN/pango-designation definitions of the variants in the newer version. Most of these are sublineage reassignments but could also be due to changes in the model's defining variants. The sublineage reassignments were reviewed to ensure they are the expected changes under a parent lineage such as reassignment among AY in the parent Delta lineage. Another source of discordance could occur in samples with <90% genomic coverage. Any discordances that could be explained by sublineage reassignments or genome coverage issues as described above were documented and further reviewed for approval. The GISAID regression test was then performed. When discordances could not be explained as above and no new pangolin lineages have been added in the upgrade, the upgrade was halted and production continued with the current version of pangolin. The discordances were documented and stored with the updates as described above. Discordances were further investigated as new information became available and documented, or initiation of this protocol for the next release of pangolin could resolve discordance. At this point, a second regression test was performed using publicly available (GISAID) sequences and their metadata. The latest GISAID sequences were downloaded and the metadata and pangolin lineages for all GISAID sequences obtained and the list of VOCs and VOIs updated based on WHO updates and the latest complete list of lineages. Next, a data simulator was used to model the coverage and error properties of the Virseq assay. The simulator used GISAID sequences as starting points and imposed simulated coverage and errors based on empirical coverage profiles and max-minor-allele frequencies from a collection of Virseq samples. The resulting, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,044 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textsimulated samples were run through pangolin, and the lineage classifications were compared to those of the original GISAID sequences. Classification stability was defined as the rate at which mutated sequences maintain their expected lineage classifications. In this regression test, two experiments were run to assess classification stability via simulation. First, up to 100 GISAID sequences were randomly sampled for each VOC/VOI to assess the classification stability of these important lineages, regardless of their frequency in the sequencing data available. This allowed an assessment of classification stability of emerging variants as well as new sublineages of existing ones. Second, 10,000 GISAID sequences from the database were randomly sampled for a frequency-based retrospective analysis of lineage classification stability. This allowed stability to be quantified relative to historical prevalence. At this point, the output of the data simulator experiments was reviewed, checking for unexpected changes in classification stabilities with respect to previous regression tests using GISAID data for all known VOC/VOIs and the retrospective GISAID data. Any unexpected instabilities were investigated and documented. The upgrade was then accepted upon satisfying certain parameters. In some cases, the upgrade was requested if the median VOC NOI concordance between the simulated data and reference sequence was at least 90%. In cases where these criteria were not met, additional investigation was indicated. If the new discordant lineage(s) were novel, the novel lineage(s) were tested to determine if they were detected using the methods disclosed herein. If the discordant variant(s) were not novel variant(s), they were investigated to find the root cause of discordance. This involved looking at the coverage of the reference sequence as well as the simulated sequences to ensure there was not an undesirable drop in base coverage in specific regions. Also, the simulation was re-run with another seed to determine if the discordance was reproduced. If it was, the upgrade was halted. At this point the novel variants were assessed using the methods disclosed herein. For successful surveillance of emerging variants (lineages), the potential impact on the molecular loop inversion probe amplification was reviewed by conducting an in silico analysis as for example by identifying the location of the individual sequence variants in the emerging lineages and the associated molecular loop probes to assess the potential for interference in probe binding. For example, a very conservative estimate that the novel sequence variant overlapping with any probe will impact hybridization would then be used. Also, all adjacent probes in the region were reviewed to ensure coverage of the novel sequence variant. For any sequence variant that could result in a reduction of coverage within a particular region, the impacted probes within the pangolin lineage update validation summary, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to the technical field of leather making, and in particular to a tanning agent-free leather making method. BACKGROUND Chrome tanning has always been the most commonly used method in the leather making (Yao Q, Chen H, Jiao Q, et al. Hydroxyl-Terminated Dendrimer Acting as a High Exhaustion Agent for Chrome Tanning[J].  Chemistry Select,  . Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association,  . Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association,  Contact Dermatitis,  At present, a variety of chrome-free tanning agents have been developed for leather making, mainly including chrome-free metal tanning agents (such as titanium, zirconium, and aluminum tanning agents) and chrome-free non-metal tanning agents (such as vegetable tanning agents, aldehyde tanning agents, and synthetic tanning agents) (Liu B, Wei Z, Wang Y, et al. Preparation of Oxidized Poly (2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) with Multiple Aldehyde Groups by TEMPO-mediated Oxidation for Gelatin Crosslinking[J] . Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association,  . Journal of Leather Science and Engineering,  China Leather,  Compared with a raw hide, leather has a significantly reduced water content and significantly improved dispersion degree of collagen fibers. Therefore, the tanning agent-free leather making method, where a raw hide is dehydrated to reduce the water content and disperse the collagen fibers, has become a new development direction of chrome free leather making. Polar organic solvents have a dehydration effect. Thus, it is an important tanning agent-free leather making method to directly dehydrate a raw hide by polar organic solvent, and then conduct a hydrophobic treatment by increasing the surface roughness of the dehydrated hide and reducing the surface energy of the dehydrated hide (Huang X, He X, Shi B. Preparation Method of Chrome-free Leather with Hydrophobic and Highly-dispersed Hide Fiber Structures [P]. Sichuan Province: CN109234476A; and Shi B, He X, Zhou J, Wang Y, Zeng Y. Preparation Method of Dehydrated Hide [P]. Sichuan Province: CN109385493A). However, when a polar organic solvent is used to dehydrate a raw hide, the dehydration performance of the polar organic solvent is significantly reduced after the water in the raw hide is gradually removed and enters the polar organic solvent. With the progress of dehydration, the water distribution between the polar organic solvent and the raw hide reaches a balance, and it is necessary to replace the used polar organic solvent with a fresh polar organic solvent to further remove the water remaining in the raw hide. Therefore, the dehydration of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,049 - WARNING - An error occurred: input texta raw hide by using a polar organic solvent requires the multi-replacement of the polar organic solvent to achieve a prominent dehydration effect. In addition, a polar organic solvent used in dehydration has a high water content and cannot be reused for dehydration of a raw hide, which causes the problems of low solvent utilization and solvent emission. Furthermore, in the existing tanning agent-free leather making technology, the surface roughness of a dehydrated hide is enhanced through in-situ hydrolysis to achieve a hydrophobic treatment, and the accurate control of a degree of the in-situ hydrolysis is required, which is not conducive to industrial scale-up. At present, there is an urgent need to solve the above-mentioned bottleneck problems of tanning agent-free leather making. SUMMARY In order to solve the problems in the background, the present disclosure provides a tanning agent-free leather making method. A tanning agent-free leather making method is provided, including subjecting a raw hide to controllable dehydration with molecular sieve-polar organic solvent composite dehydration media. Further, the polar organic solvent includes, but is not limited to, any one or a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and acetone. Further, the raw hide includes, but is not limited to, cowhide and sheepskin. Further, a weight of the polar organic solvent used is 2.0 to 8.0 times a weight of the raw hide, and a weight of the molecular sieve used is 2.0 to 8.0 times the weight of the raw hide. Further, the molecular sieve and the polar organic solvent are added in the order as follows: adding the molecular sieve and the polar organic solvent together to dehydrate the raw hide; or adding the polar organic solvent first to dehydrate the raw hide, and then adding the molecular sieve to reach a combined dehydration action. Further, after subjecting the raw hide to controllable dehydration, the method further includes the following steps: drying a dehydrated hide obtained after the controllable dehydration to obtain a crust; subjecting the crust to a hydrophobic treatment; and drying a hide obtained after the hydrophobic treatment. Further, a method of the hydrophobic treatment includes: dispersing an oxide in a solvent to obtain a suspension, applying the suspension to a surface of the crust through suction filtration, drying the hide, and immersing the hide in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution, where the oxide is any one selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and magnesium oxide. Further, a weight of the oxide is 8.0% to 20% of a weight of the crust; a weight of the solvent is 10 to 16 times the weight of the crust; and a weight of the PDMS is 5.0 to 12 times the weight of the crust. Further, after subjecting the raw hide to controllable dehydration, the method further includes the following steps: separating the molecular sieve from the polar organic solvent after the controllable, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,049 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textdehydration; subjecting the separated molecular sieve to a thermal treatment for activation; and compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent. Further, a product obtained by compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent is reused for the controllable dehydration of a raw hide. The molecular sieve used in the present disclosure is a porous material, which has excellent water adsorption capacity and stable properties and is easy to recycle. The molecular sieve used in the dehydration of the raw hide can selectively remove the water entering the polar organic solvent, such that the balance between the water remaining in the raw hide and the water entering the dehydration solvent is broken and the water remaining in the raw hide can be continuously removed and transferred to the polar organic solvent, which achieves a one-step controllable dehydration of water in the raw hide without solvent replacement, and solves the problem that the dehydration by using only polar organic solvent requires the multi-replacement of the solvent. Moreover, the molecular sieve is easily separated and recovered from the polar organic solvent after being used for dehydration, and the recovered molecular sieve can be activated by a thermal treatment and then reused together with the separated and recovered polar organic solvent for raw hide dehydration, thereby realizing the recycling of the polar organic solvent and the molecular sieve for the controllable dehydration of the raw hide. In addition, the method for improving the surface roughness of the dehydrated hide by applying the oxide to the surface of the dehydrated hide through suction filtration has the advantages of convenience, high efficiency, and easy industrial scale-up. Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the following advantages: The method provided by the present disclosure does not use any metal or non-metal tanning agent, which is eco-friendly. The controllable dehydration leather making method provided by the present disclosure breaks the balance of water distribution between the raw hide and the polar organic solvent, and realizes a multi-medium self-driven directional controllable dehydration of the raw hide where the water moves from the raw hide to the polar organic solvent and further into the molecular sieve, promoting the continuous and controllable dehydration of water in the raw hide, and effectively solving the problems during dehydration of the raw hide using a single polar organic solvent, namely, the dehydration efficiency is low, and the polar organic solvent needs to be changed multiple times for dehydration and is difficult to be recycled. In the method provided by the present disclosure, the used solvent does not require purification, and can be directly reused with the molecular sieve activated by a thermal treatment for tanning agent-free, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

2023-07-05 15:08:37,054 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textThe invention relates to an apparatus for the production of molten iron comprising a metallurgical vessel, having a surrounding wall, a cyclone part provided on top of a smelt reduction part, the cyclone part being in open connection with the smelt reduction part and having at least one supply means around the circumference of the surrounding wall adjusted to introduce oxygen gas into the cyclone part. The invention also relates to a method of producing molten iron in a metallurgical vessel. Apparatuses for the production of molten iron are known in the art. EP 0726 326 A1 describes such an apparatus, which is also known as the Hlsarna process by Tata Steel. Supply means around the circumference of the surrounding wall adjusted to introduce oxygen gas are known as well. For example EP 2794 931 B1 describes supply means adjusted for the introduction of oxygen gas into the cyclone part of the metallurgical vessel. Unfortunately, this type of metallurgical vessel, having a cyclone part and a smelt reduction part, has the disadvantage that both parts cannot be controlled in an independent manner. Especially the temperature control inside the metallurgical vessel is difficult, as both parts are in open connection with each other. This means that an adjustment in the smelt reduction part influences the cyclone part and vice versa. The temperature control in the smelt reduction part is usually controlled by inserting a carbon containing material in the slag layer. However, the insertion does not generate enough heat for the conversion from carbon, via carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The injection of oxygen gas in this part does generate enough energy, and therefore heat, as it converts the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. In order to keep the temperature within the processing window in the cyclone part, carbon containing material could be added in the smelt reduction part in the desired content. However, this still can lead to a lower than desired temperature in the cyclone part and the current way to solve this is by the addition of even more oxygen gas in the smelt reduction vessel. This in turn will then lead to a temperature that may be too high in the smelt reduction part. The balance in temperature between the cyclone part and the smelt reduction part is therefore a delicate one and both parts are not controlled well enough. The inventors, being involved in finding more environmentally friendly solutions for molten iron production, found that this process could be controlled in a better way. The object of this invention is to provide an apparatus and method that has a better control over the process. It is a further object to make better use of waste materials and to produce less waste material during the ironmaking process, with an emphasis on lowering the emission of CO 2  Accordingly, an apparatus and method for the production of molten iron is provided wherein the at least one supply means is further adjusted to introduce a mixture of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Preferably, the supply means are symmetrically distributed over the circumference of the surrounding wall of the cyclone part or at the top of the smelt reduction unit. This is beneficial for a good gas distribution within the cyclone part of the metallurgical vessel and thereby also the temperature distribution. The top of the smelt reduction unit is located at or near the roof of the smelt reduction unit, just below the cyclone part. Preferably, the supply means are adjusted to mix the oxygen gas and the combustible gas before entering the cyclone part. This is beneficial since this premixing increases the control of the mixture that is introduced into the cyclone part of the metallurgical vessel. Preferably, a group of oxygen gas outlets is surrounding one or more combustible gas outlets. Preferably, a group of combustible gas outlets is surrounding one or more oxygen gas outlets. These embodiments both have the advantage that the mixture will be premixed just before being introduced into the cyclone part, even further improving control.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,058 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention concerns a lance for immersion of a probe into molten metal contained in a metallurgical vessel, such as a converter for making steel. The lance is of the type comprising a top lance, which is reusable and does not contact the molten metal, and a sublance coupled to the top lance and holding at a free end thereof a probe for measuring parameters of the molten metal, and/or a sampling tool for collecting a sample of molten metal. In use, the sublance is immersed partially into the molten metal and is disposable. The connection between the top lance and the sublance defines a shoulder, since the top lance has a larger diameter than the sublance. If molten metal splatters onto the shoulder of the top lance, it may, once solidified, jeopardize the coupling of a new sublance to the top lance. The present invention proposes a sublance provided with a protecting device preventing splattering of molten metal or slag onto the shoulder region of the top lance. To facilitate storing of the sublances in existing racks, and for handling the sublances by a robot without changing the programming of the robot, the protecting device stored in the rack has a diameter similar to the diameter of the sublance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metal production processes are carried out in metallurgical vessels at high temperatures, undergoing chemical or physical reactions, whether desired or undesired, during the residence time or transfers from one vessel to another of molten metal and/or slag. Since the properties of the final metal products thus produced are strongly dependent on the process conditions, including temperature, pH, and on whether or not desired and undesired chemical or physical reactions occurred, it is important to measure such parameters and also to collect samples in situ, for further characterization. This is generally carried out with a lance comprising a top lance which remains out of the molten metal or slag and a sublance coupled to the top lance and provided with a probe and/or a sample collector at a free end thereof. The top lance is generally made of metal or polymer and is reusable. The sublance, on the other hand, is generally made of thick cardboard and is disposable. For example, steel can be produced from carbon-rich molten pig iron by an oxygen converter process, wherein oxygen is blown with a lance ( 12 FIG.  1 A new sublance is inserted over a coupling portion of the top lance until it reaches a shoulder formed by a handling portion of the top lance which has a diameter larger than the sublance. Because of vibrations during use, it is possible that the sublance loses contact with the shoulder forming a small gap. The molten metal ( 11 11 s U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,343 and EP3588052 describe solutions for preventing the formation of metal incrustations at a gap between the sublance and the shoulder. U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,343 describes an elastic ring seal between the immersion end of the shoulder of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,058 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textthe top lance and the top of the sublance to reduce the deposition of frozen metal at the joint between the top lance and the sublance. EP3588052 describes a similar solution, using two elastic ring seals arranged at the end portion of the sublance, wherein the two elastic ring seals are arranged circumferentially on top of each other for sealing a space between the coupling tap and the end portion of the sublance. These solutions protect a gap between the sublance and the shoulder from being reached by metal or slag splatters. As mentioned supra, a gap does not necessarily occur, and these solutions do not protect the shoulder from metal splattering. KR101597688 proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of the top lance from metal splattering. The top end of the sublance is provided with an anti-stick cover formed by an inner ring comprising an inner passage suitable for engaging into the coupling portion of the top lance, and an outer ring, coaxial with and separate from the inner ring, having a larger diameter than the inner ring, which matches the diameter of the shoulder and protects it from metal splattering. The problem with this solution is that the outer ring has a diameter substantially larger than the diameter of the sublance. It follows that the racks traditionally used for storing new sublances awaiting their utilization cannot be used anymore without amending the dimensions of the receiving means to match the dimensions of the anti-stick covers. Furthermore, the change of the geometry of the top end of the sublance with the coupling of the anti-stick cover may require a change in the programming of the robots used for handling the sublances and for coupling them to or retrieving them from the top lance. The present invention proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of a top lance as well as any gap formed between said shoulder and a sublance, maintaining the geometry of the top of the sublance substantially unamended. This solution has the advantage that it can be implemented by replacing one-to-one existing sublances without requiring any design change of the existing racks used for storing the sublances and with no programming change of the robots used to handle the sublances. The solution has the advantage that the conformance of the protecting device to a surface of the top lance and conformance to a surface of the sublance is the result of the deformation of the entire device, rather than the deformation of a surface of an elastic material.” and “This solution has the advantage that the expandable radially protective device expands only after the top lance and sublance have been joined axially, thus reducing the possibility of damage during handling and assembly.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a seamless steel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance, and to a method for manufacturing the same. Specifically, the present invention relates to a seamless steel pipe suitable for piping in a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosive environment created by the combustion exhaust gas of boilers, gasification melting furnaces, and the like, particularly, a seamless steel pipe for piping useful for preventing scattering of corrosion products produced by sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion, and that exhibits desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance in a heat recovery steam generator, and to a method for manufacturing such a seamless steel pipe. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the gas flue of boilers, thermal power plants, and other such devices or facilities that burn sulfur-containing fuel such as heavy oil and coal, the sulfur oxide contained in exhaust gas turns into sulfuric acid as it condenses with a temperature drop. This causes severe corrosion called sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion. To be more specific, in a seamless steel pipe used for heat recovery pipes of heat recovery steam generators, sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion can lead to accidents by reducing the pipe lifetime or damaging pipes. There is also a possibility of causing exfoliation of corrosion products produced by sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion, and the corrosion products may affect the surrounding environment when scattered into the surroundings through an exhaust duct of a boiler. Various proposals have been made to reduce the sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion itself. For example, PTL 1 discloses a steel containing 0.001 to 0.2 mass % carbon and to which appropriate amounts of Si, Mn, P, and S, and, additionally, Cu: 0.1 to 1 mass %, Mo: 0.001 to 1 mass %, and Sb: 0.01 to 0.2 mass % are added to obtain a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistant steel containing controlled amounts of Sb, C, and Mo satisfying a specific relationship. PTL 2 discloses adding W, Sn, and Cr to a steel containing C: 0.01 to 0.12 mass %, Cu: 0.03 to 1.0 mass %, and Sb: 0.002 to 0.7 mass %, and controlling the C, Sb, and W contents to satisfy a specific relationship, and provide a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistant steel having improved sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance and hydrochloric acid dew-point corrosion resistance. Patent Literature PTL 1: JP-A-2003-213367 PTL 2: JP-A-2007-262558 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The techniques disclosed in PTL 1 and PTL 2 are intended to lower the sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion rate or hydrochloric acid dew-point corrosion, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

It is, however, difficult to sufficiently inhibit sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion in a more severe environment with a sulfuric acid concentration as high as 70 mass %. PTL 1 and PTL 2 are also totally silent as to exfoliation of corrosion products produced in such an environment. These related art documents also do not contain detailed descriptions related to manufacture of a seamless steel pipe suited for piping in heat recovery steam generators, and do not provide optimum conditions that ensure both sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance and manufacturability of a seamless steel pipe. Aspects of the present invention were made under these circumstances, and it is an object according to aspects of the present invention to provide a seamless steel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance, and that is suited for piping in a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosive environment such as in a heat recovery steam generator while being desirably manufacturable. Another object according to aspects of the present invention is to provide a suitable method of manufacture of the seamless steel pipe. In order to find a solution to the foregoing problems, the present inventors conducted intensive studies of exfoliation of corrosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosive environment. Specifically, a seamless steel pipe measuring 138.9 mm in outer diameter and 10.8 mm in wall thickness was produced from a steel pipe material prepared by appropriately adding Sn, W, and Cr to a base steel pipe material of a composition containing, in mass %, basic chemical components C: 0.04%, Si: 0.2%, Mn: 1.4%, and Al: 0.02%, and, additionally, Cu and Sb added as elements that are considered effective for acid resistance. The seamless steel pipe was subjected to a normalizing heat treatment at a normalizing temperature of 950° C., and a corrosion test specimen was taken from the outer surface side of the steel pipe. Specifically, a corrosion test specimen (30 mm in length ×20 mm in width×5 mm in thickness) including an outer surface of steel pipe was taken from the outer surface side of steel pipe, and a surface corresponding to the outer surface side of steel pipe was ground by 0.5 mm to remove unwanted components such as scale. The specimen was then subjected to a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion test using the procedures schematically represented in  FIG.  1 As shown in  FIG.  1 1 FIG.  1 1 1 2 I  2 1 2 II  2 II I, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

First, the reasons for limiting the composition of a seamless steel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance according to aspects of the present invention are described below. As used herein, “%” used as a unit of the content of a component means “mass %”, unless otherwise specifically stated. A seamless steel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corrosion resistance according to aspects of the present invention will also be referred to simply as “seamless steel pipe according to aspects of the present invention”. C: 0.02 to 0.12% C is an element that increases steel strength. In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a C content of 0.02% or more is needed to satisfy the required yield strength and tensile strength, particularly when the seamless steel pipe is used for piping. For this reason, the C content is 0.02% or more. The C content is preferably 0.021% or more, more preferably 0.022% or more. A C content of more than 0.12% has adverse effects on high-temperature hot ductility. Specifically, a C content of more than 0.12% causes surface defects during hot rolling of a seamless steel pipe. For this reason, the upper limit of C content is 0.12%. For prevention of surface defects, the C content is preferably 0.08% or less, more preferably 0.04% or less. Si: 0.010 to 1.00% Si is an element that acts as a deoxidizing agent, and increases steel strength by forming a solid solution in steel. In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a Si content of 0.010% or more is needed to satisfy the required yield strength and tensile strength, particularly when the seamless steel pipe is used for piping. For this reason, the Si content is 0.010% or more. The Si content is preferably 0.05% or more, more preferably 0.20% or more. A Si content of more than 1.00% has adverse effects on high-temperature hot ductility. For this reason, the upper limit of Si content is 1.00%. The Si content is preferably 0.80% or less, more preferably 0.60% or less. Mn: 0.10 to 2.00% Mn is an element that increases steel strength by improving hardenability. In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a Mn content of 0.10% or more is needed to satisfy the required yield strength and tensile strength, particularly when the seamless steel pipe is used for piping. For this reason, the Mn content is 0.10% or more. The Mn content is preferably 0.50% or more, more preferably 1.10% or more. A Mn content of more than 2.00% causes severe centerline segregation during continuous casting, and leads to internal defects at the time of piercing during hot rolling of a seamless steel pipe. For this reason, the upper limit of Mn content is 2.00%. The Mn content is preferably 1.80% or less, more preferably 1.40% or less.

For this reason, it is preferable in accordance with aspects of the present invention that the P content be reduced as much as possible. However, a P content of at most 0.050% is acceptable. For this reason, the P content is 0.050% or less. The P content is preferably 0.030% or less, more preferably 0.015% or less. The lower limit of P content is not particularly limited. However, the preferred lower limit of P content is about 0.004% because excessive dephosphorization leads to increase of manufacturing cost. S: 0.004% or Less S also causes serious centerline segregation during continuous casting, and leads to internal defects at the time of piercing during hot rolling of a seamless steel pipe. For this reason, it is desirable in accordance with aspects of the present invention to reduce the S content as much as possible. However, a S content of at most 0.004% is acceptable. For this reason, the S content is 0.004% or less. The S content is preferably 0.003% or less, more preferably 0.002% or less. The lower limit of S content is not particularly limited. However, the preferred lower limit of S content is about 0.0004% because excessive desulfurization leads to increase of manufacturing cost. Al: 0.010 to 0.100% Al is an element that acts as a deoxidizing agent. An Al content of 0.010% or more is needed to reduce solid solution oxygen, and prevent decrease of the effective amount of Cr due to chromium oxide formation. For this reason, the Al content is 0.010% or more. The Al content is preferably 0.015% or more, more preferably 0.020% or more . An Al content of more than 0.100% results in producing large amounts of Al 2 3  Cu: 0.03 to 0.80% Cu is an element that is effective at preventing steel corrosion in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment. Cu also acts to improve the exfoliation of corrosion products when enriched in the outer surface of the steel pipe with Cr. A Cu content of 0.03% or more is needed to obtain such an effect. For this reason, the Cu content is 0.03% or more. The Cu content is preferably 0.10% or more, more preferably 0.20% or more. It is well known that Cu decreases the high-temperature ductility of steel, and, accordingly, the upper limit of Cu content is 0.80% because a Cu content of more than 0.80% results in producing notable defects in outer surface during hot rolling. The Cu content is preferably 0.60% or less, more preferably 0.40% or less. Ni: 0.02 to 0.50% Ni is an element that inhibits decrease of high-temperature ductility of Cu when added to a Cu-containing steel. A Ni content of 0.02% or more is needed to obtain such an effect. For this reason, the Ni content is 0.02% or more. The Ni content is preferably 0.08% or more, more preferably 0.10% or more. The upper limit of Ni content is 0.50% because Ni is an expensive element to add, and the effect becomes, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The Ni content is preferably 0.45% or less, more preferably 0.30% or less. Cr: 0.55 to 1.00% Cr does not greatly contribute to preventing the corrosion itself in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment. However, as shown in  FIG.  2 Sb: 0.005 to 0.20% Sb, as is Cu, is an element that is effective at preventing steel corrosion in a sulfuric acid dew-point corrosive environment. Sb also acts to improve the exfoliation of corrosion products when enriched in the outer surface of a steel pipe with Cr. An Sb content of 0.005% or more is needed to obtain these effects. For this reason, the Sb content is 0.005% or more. The Sb content is preferably 0.02% or more, more preferably 0.05% or more. The upper limit of Sb content is 0.20% because an Sb content of more than 0.20% seriously decreases high-temperature ductility, and causes severe outer surface defects during hot rolling. The Sb content is preferably 0.15% or less, more preferably 0.09% or less. In addition to the foregoing preferred basic components, aspects of the present invention may optionally contain one or both of W: 0.003 to 0.040% and Sn: 0.005 to 0.5%. W: 0.003 to 0.040% The present inventors found that W improves the exfoliation of corrosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, as does Cr. However, unlike Cr, W is an expensive element, and may be added with Cr for additional improvement of the exfoliation of corrosion products. A W content of 0.003% or more is needed to obtain such an effect. For this reason, W, when contained, is contained in an amount of 0.003% or more. The W content is preferably 0.005% or more, more preferably 0.008% or more. A W content of more than 0.040% promotes formation of internal defects at the time of piercing during hot rolling of a seamless steel pipe, particularly in a portion of steel pipe corresponding to the centerline segregation occurring in continuous casting. For this reason, the upper limit of W, when contained, is 0.040%. The W content is preferably 0.030% or less, more preferably 0.015% or less. Sn: 0.005 to 0.5% Sn has only limited effects for the improvement of the exfoliation of corrosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, as shown in  FIG.  2 In the foregoing composition, the balance is Fe and incidental impurities. Specific examples of the incidental impurity elements include H, O, Co, As, Zr, Ag, Ta, and Pb. The acceptable upper limits of these incidental impurities are H: 0.0005%, O: 0.004%, Co: 0.001%, As: 0.006%, Zr: 0.0004%, Ag: 0.001%, Ta: 0.004%, and Pb: 0.005%.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,081 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmolten steel is cast preferably by continuous casting. The manufacturing conditions of the manufacturing process following continuous casting are different for continuous casting that continuously casts molten steel into a common cast piece having a rectangular cross section, such as a slab or a bloom, and for continuous casting that continuously casts molten steel directly into a cast piece having a circular cross section more suited for hot rolling into a seamless steel pipe. The cast piece having a rectangular cross section is a column that is substantially quadrangular in shape, whereas the cast piece having a circular cross section is substantially cylindrical in shape. In the case of continuous casting into a cast piece having a rectangular cross section, the cast piece having a rectangular cross section is heated to a predetermined heating temperature, and hot rolled into a steel pipe material having a circular cross section. The heating temperature is as follows. In accordance with aspects of the present invention, temperatures such as the heating temperature, hot rolling temperature, normalizing temperature, and cooling stop temperature of a cast piece, a steel pipe material, and a steel pipe are surface temperatures of a cast piece, a steel pipe material, and a steel pipe (outer surface temperature in the case of a steel pipe), unless otherwise specifically stated, and can be measured with, for example, a radiation thermometer. Heating Temperature: 1,000 to 1,200° C. Temperature Region In order to form a steel pipe material of a circular cross section by rolling (billet rolling) a cast piece having a rectangular cross section, the cast piece needs to be hot rolled in a temperature region of the austenitic phase of steel. Aspects of the present invention are intended to inhibit the exfoliation of corrosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, and the seamless steel pipe after the steel pipe heat treatment described below needs to have Cu, Cr, Sb, and W enriched in the outer surface. The heating temperature of billet rolling affects the enrichment of these elements. Specifically, when the heating temperature of billet rolling is less than 1,000° C., it is not possible to sufficiently enrich these elements in the outer surface of the cast piece (cast-piece surface), and Cu, Cr, Sb, and W cannot have the required concentrations in the outer surface of the seamless steel pipe after the final steel pipe heat treatment. The cast piece of a rectangular cross section is therefore heated to a heating temperature in a temperature region of 1,000° C. or more before hot rolling. That is, the heating temperature at the start of hot rolling (billet rolling) is 1,000° C. or more. The heating temperature is preferably 1,050° C. or more, more preferably 1,100° C. or more. The upper limit of heating temperature is 1,200° C. This is because the enrichment of the foregoing alloy elements becomes saturated at about 1,180° C. or more,, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The heating temperature is preferably 1,190° C. or less, more preferably 1,180° C. or less. Heating Time from 900° C. to Heating Temperature: At Least 1.5 Hours (Preferred Condition) In order to more effectively enrich elements such as Cu, Cr, Sb, W in the outer surface of the seamless steel pipe, it is preferable to increase the heating time particularly above 900° C. Specifically, the enrichment of elements such as Cu, Cr, Sb, and W becomes more notable when the time length of heating from 900° C. to the target heating temperature of billet rolling is at least 1.5 hours, regardless of the heating temperature of billet rolling. It is therefore preferable that the time length of heating from 900° C. to the heating temperature of billet rolling be at least 1.5 hours. The heating time is more preferably at least 2.0 hours. The upper limit of heating time is 3.0 hours because the effect becomes saturated with a heating time longer than 3.0 hours, and increasing the heating time longer than 3.0 hours is not economically advantageous in terms of expenses such as fuel cost. The cast piece of a rectangular cross section is hot rolled (billet rolling) immediately after being heated to the target heating temperature in the 1,000 to 1,200° C. temperature region, preferably within 60 seconds after heating. The hot rolling end temperature (billet-rolling end temperature) is not particularly limited. However, considering the rolling load on a rolling mill, the hot rolling temperature end temperature (billet-rolling end temperature) is preferably 800° C. or more, more preferably 900° C. or more. The hot rolling (billet rolling) is followed by cooling to room temperature. As used herein, “room temperature” means 25° C. The cooling method is not particularly limited. Typically, cooling is achieved by air cooling with, for example, a cooling bed. However, cooling may be achieved by weak water cooling, in order to reduce the time to cool to room temperature, and to increase the number of rolled pipes per hour. As used herein, “air cooling” means natural cooling that takes place without the use of any cooling means. Typically, the average cooling rate of air cooling is 1° C./s or less. In the case of continuous casting to a cast piece having a circular cross section, the cast piece is heated (cast-piece heat treatment) into a steel pipe material before rolled into a steel pipe (tubing) . The heating temperature of the cast-piece heat treatment is as follows. Heating Temperature of Cast-Piece Heat Treatment: 1,000 to 1,200° C. Temperature Region The cast-piece heat treatment adopts the same heating temperature as billet rolling to ensure the same effect.

In the cast-piece heat treatment process, the cast piece having reached the target heating temperature is immediately taken out of the furnace, and cooled to room temperature. The cooling method after the cast-piece heat treatment is not particularly limited. Typically, cooling is achieved by air cooling with, for example, a cooling bed. However, cooling may be achieved by weak water cooling, in order to reduce the time to cool to room temperature, and to increase the number of heat treatment pipes per hour. The steel pipe material after the billet rolling or cast-piece heat treatment is used to form a seamless steel pipe of a predetermined shape in a hot process (tubing process). In the tubing process, the steel pipe material may be formed into a seamless steel pipe of a predetermined shape by a process that hot rolls the preheated steel pipe material (piercing followed by mandrel mill rolling or plug mill rolling into a predetermined wall thickness, and rolling into an appropriately reduced diameter) . The heating temperature and hot rolling temperature of the steel pipe material are as follows. Steel Pipe Material Heating Temperature: 1,100 to 1,300° C.

In order to prevent defects, the steel pipe material is heated to a heating temperature of 1,100° C. or more because a steel pipe material heating temperature of less than 1,100° C. causes severe internal defects during piercing, and defects detected in a nondestructive testing after the final steel pipe heat treatment cannot be removed even when the steel pipe is subjected to repair or finishing to make it acceptable. The steel pipe material heating temperature is preferably 1,150° C. or more, more preferably 1,200° C. or more. The upper limit of steel pipe material heating temperature is 1,300° C. because a steel pipe material heating temperature of more than 1,300° C. results in a loss of steel surface by oxidation, and increased fuel costs, among other economic disadvantages. The steel pipe material heating temperature is preferably 1,290° C. or less, more preferably 1,280° C. or less. Hot Rolling Temperature: 800° C. or More With a rolling temperature of hot rolling (steel pipe rolling) below 800° C., the high-temperature ductility of steel decreases, and defects occur in outer surface during hot rolling. The defects remain even after the steel pipe heat treatment, and defects detected in a nondestructive testing cannot be removed even when the steel pipe is subjected to repair or finishing to make it acceptable. From the perspective of preventing defects, the hot rolling temperature is 800° C. or more. That is, the hot rolling (steel pipe rolling) end temperature is 800° C. or more. For example, when the hot rolling is a process starting from piercing followed by mandrel mill rolling or plug mill rolling and ending with diameter reduction rolling, the rolling end temperature of diameter reduction rolling is 800° C. or more. The hot rolling temperature is preferably 830° C. or more, more preferably 850° C. or more. The hot rolling of the steel pipe is followed by cooling to room temperature. The cooling method is not particularly limited. Typically, cooling is achieved by air cooling with, for example, a cooling bed. However, cooling may be achieved by weak water cooling, in order to reduce the time to cool to room temperature, and to increase the number of rolled pipes per hour. The seamless steel pipe cooled to room temperature after the tubing process is subjected to a normalizing heat treatment (steel pipe heat treatment process) . The purpose of the normalizing heat treatment is to adjust the hardness of the seamless steel pipe to a predetermined strength suited for piping. The heat treatment temperature (normalizing temperature) of the normalizing heat treatment is as follows. Normalizing Temperature: 850 to 1,050° C. When the normalizing temperature of normalizing heat treatment is less than 850° C., transformation into austenite does not proceed to completion in part of the steel, and untransformed ferrite and perlite, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Because the ferrite and perlite structure causes decrease of steel strength, the normalizing temperature is 850° C. or more. The normalizing temperature is preferably 880° C. or more, more preferably 900° C. or more. With a normalizing temperature of more than 1,050° C., serious grain growth occurs after transformation into austenite, and coarse ferrite grains are formed by transformation in the course of cooling after the normalizing heat treatment, with the result that the yield strength decreases. For this reason, the normalizing temperature is 1,050° C. or less. The normalizing temperature is preferably 1,000° C. or less, more preferably 950° C. or less. Preferably, the cooling after the normalizing heat treatment is air cooling with, for example, a cooling bed. When cooling is achieved by weak water cooling to increase the number of rolled pipes per hour, it is preferable to start the cooling process from 500° C. or less, a temperature sufficiently lower than the temperature at the end of transformation. EXAMPLES Molten steels of the compositions shown in Tables 1 and 2 were made by a method using a converter, and were each cast into a cast piece by continuous casting. In continuous casting, some steels were cast into cast pieces having a rectangular cross section (300 mm in thickness×400 mm in width) while the others were cast into cast pieces having a circular cross section (190 mm in diameter). The cast piece having a rectangular cross section was heated at a predetermined heating temperature, and hot rolled into a steel pipe material (billet-rolled steel pipe material) measuring 190 mm or 140 mm in diameter. Seamless steel pipes made from such a steel pipe material are denoted as “Billet rolled” under the heading “Type of steel pipe material” in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The heating temperature, the heating time from 900° C. to heating temperature, and the billet-rolling end temperature of billet rolling are as shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The cast piece having a circular cross section was prepared into a steel pipe material by cast-piece heat treatment, except for some comparative materials. Steel pipes produced from the steel pipe material obtained by cast-piece heat treatment are denoted as “Cast-piece heat treatment” under the heading “Type of steel pipe material” in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

The 0.5-mm region just below the outer surface of the steel pipe was excluded from the measurement region because an accurate line analysis cannot be expected from a region this close to the sample surface. A tensile test specimen was taken from arbitrarily chosen longitudinal and circumferential locations of the steel pipe. Steel pipes with an outer diameter of less than 170 mm were prepared into test specimens according to JIS Z2241 12B, whereas steel pipes with an outer diameter of 170 mm or more were prepared into test specimens according to JIS Z2241 12C. The tensile test was conducted according to JIS 22241. The yield strength and tensile strength obtained in the tensile test are shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. Steel pipes were determined as being acceptable when the yield strength was 230 MPa or more, and the tensile strength was 380 MPa or more. The yield strength is preferably 250 MPa or more, and the tensile strength is preferably 400 MPa or more.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,100 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a rolling bearing. More particularly, the present invention relates to a tapered roller bearing, a cylindrical roller bearing, or a deep groove ball bearing. BACKGROUND ART A rolling fatigue life of a rolling bearing is improved by carbonitriding a surface of a bearing part (a raceway surface of each of an inner ring and an outer ring as well as a rolling contact surface of a rolling element) as described in PTL 1 (Japanese Patent No. 5592540). Moreover, the rolling fatigue life of the rolling bearing is improved by attaining fine prior austenite grains in the surface of the bearing part as described in PTL 2 (Japanese Patent No. 3905430). CITATION LIST Patent Literature PTL 1: Japanese Patent No. 5592540 PTL 2: Japanese Patent No. 3905430 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem A steel used for the bearing part is generally quenched. That is, a quench-hardened layer having a structure mainly composed of a martensite phase is formed in the surface of the bearing part. However, it has not been conventionally known how states of martensite crystal grains affect the rolling fatigue life of the bearing part. In a transmission or differential for an automobile, a low-viscosity lubricating oil tends to be applied in order to improve fuel efficiency or an amount of lubricating oil in a unit tends to be reduced, and such tendencies are also considered to continue in future. Therefore, in a rolling bearing used in such a severe lubricating state, a material matrix of a surface layer of a quench-hardened layer needs to be composed of a stronger structure. Further, in response to downsizing of units, the size (outer diameter or width) of the rolling bearing is required to be decreased; however, an output tends to be high due to motor assisting or provision of a turbo mechanism and an applied load to the rolling bearing (a ratio of the applied load to the bearing rated load) tends to be increased, so that a longer life of the rolling bearing is required. Further, in view of increased popularity of urban car sharing in future, frequency of use and travel distance of an automobile tend to be increased, so that a longer life of the rolling bearing has been desired more than ever. A maximum contact pressure is applied to a rolling surface (raceway surface or rolling contact surface) at a central position in a rolling surface axial direction. Therefore, in order to attain a long life of the rolling bearing, it is particularly important to improve the material structure of the quench-hardened layer in the rolling surface at the central position in the rolling surface axial direction. The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problem of the conventional art. More specifically, the present invention is to provide a rolling bearing having an improved rolling fatigue life. Solution to Problem A rolling bearing according to a first implementation of the present invention is a tapered roller, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

No. 16/743,235, filed Jan. 15, 2020, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/591,604, filed May 10, 2017, and issued on Mar. 10, 2020 as U.S. Pat. No. 10,584,397, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/182,013, filed on Jul. 13, 2011, and issued on Jul. 11, 2017 as U.S. Pat. No. 9,700,937, which claims priority to German Application No. DE 10 2010 036 401.0, filed on Jul. 14, 2010. The entire disclosure of each of the above applications is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Field Disclosed herein is a device and to a method for the production of a metallic strip, in particular using a rapid solidification technology. 2. Description of Related Art In a rapid solidification technology, a melt is poured onto a fast-moving heat sink, and the melt solidifies on the heat sink owing to the thermal conductivity of the latter. If the melt is continuously poured onto the moving heat sink, a strip is produced. U.S. Pat. No. 4,793,400 discloses a device of this type for the production of a metallic strip. The device comprises two rotatable brushes which are used for cleaning the surface of the heat sink before the melt is applied to the heat sink. These brushes are used for removing dust, rubble and melt residues from the surface. The aim of this arrangement was to produce very few faults in the rapidly solidified strip and to produce a more homogeneous strip. The device further comprises a vacuum source which picks up the removed objects, ensuring that they are removed reliably and not returned to the surface. Further improvements are, however, desirable if the quality of the strip, for example its homogeneity, is to be improved. SUMMARY An embodiment disclosed herein provides a device for the production of a metallic strip by means of a rapid solidification technology, which device comprises a movable heat sink with an external surface and a rolling device. A melt is poured onto the external surface and there solidifies while a strip is produced. The rolling device can be pressed against the external surface of the movable heat sink while the heat sink is in motion. In embodiments of the device disclosed herein, the external surface is therefore contacted by the rolling device while the heat sink is in motion. The rolling device is used for repeatedly preparing the external surface before the melt solidifies thereon. The external surface can be roller-burnished with the rolling device and therefore worked, so that the external surface is smoothed. In this context, the term “work” should be understood to mean a redistribution of material. The removal of material from the external surface, which can be achieved by means of a brush, is not an object of the use of the rolling device. No chips are produced, and there is hardly any debris or dust which could have a negative effect on, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,127 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textthe production process. The pressure required for working the external surface depends on the material and the condition of the heat sink or of the external surface of the heat sink. A lower pressure is used for a soft material such as copper than for a hard material such as steel. The rolling device is in particular pressed against a point of the external surface of the movable heat sink which lies between the point where the strip separates from the heat sink and the pouring surface, i.e. the point of the heat sink where the melt hits the heat sink. The external surface can therefore be worked by means of the rolling device after the strip has solidified thereon and before the next contact with the melt. In one embodiment, the rolling device is pressed against the external surface of the movable heat sink in such a way that the external surface is smoothed by the rolling device. As a result, the external surface is less rough after the contact with or the working by the rolling device than before the contact with the rolling device. This has the advantage that the roughness of the strip and in particular the roughness of the surface of the strip, which is generated by the solidification of the strip on the external surface of the movable heat sink, can be kept low. As a result, the homogeneity of the strip is ensured over longer sections. This allows for a longer casting process and reduces production costs. In addition, a low roughness can improve various properties of the strip which is produced. The surface roughness of some magnetic alloys, for example, affects their magnetic properties. By producing a long strip with a homogeneous and low surface roughness, several magnet cores having homogeneous properties can be produced in one casting process. This reduces manufacturing costs, because there are fewer losses. In one embodiment, the rolling device is designed such that that it continuously contacts the external surface of the movable heat sink while the melt is poured onto the external surface of the movable heat sink. In this arrangement, the surface on which the melt solidifies can be worked before it once again meets the melt. This results in a more homogeneous external surface and therefore in rapidly solidified strips. In another embodiment, the rolling device is designed such that that it reduces the roughness of the external surface of the movable heat sink by working the external surface while the melt is poured onto the external surface of the movable heat sink. The working of the external surface therefore results in a reduced surface roughness. In one embodiment, the movable heat sink is rotatable about an axis of rotation, i.e. the movement is a rotation. In order to achieve a desired cooling rate and a desired strip thickness, the peripheral speed of the heat sink is set accordingly. As the peripheral speed increases, the strip thickness is reduced more and more. A typical cooling rate is more than 10 5  The heat sink may, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,127 - WARNING - An error occurred: input texthave the shape of a wheel or a roller, the melt being applied to the peripheral surface of the wheel or roller respectively. The axis of rotation is therefore perpendicular to the centre of the circular end of the wheel. In one embodiment, the rolling device is movable parallel to the axis of rotation of the movable heat sink. In this arrangement, the rolling device can be brought into contact with different regions of the width of the heat sink, for example with only a part of the peripheral surface of the wheel. This can be advantageous if there are several casting tracks on a heat sink. One casting track can be worked by the rolling device after another casting track, so that several casts can be made with one and the same heat sink but with different casting tracks, without having to exchange the heat sink. This may reduce production times and therefore production costs. The rolling device may alternatively be movable at right angles to the external surface of the movable heat sink. If the external surface moves in the z-direction, the rolling device may be movable in the x-direction and/or in the y-direction. Movement in the x-direction may for example allow different strip-shaped regions of the external surface to be worked. Movement in the y-direction can be used for adjusting the pressure with which the rolling device can be pressed against the external surface. In one embodiment, the rolling device comprises a roller which can be rotatably pressed onto the external surface of the movable heat sink. The roller of the rolling device therefore contacts the external surface of the movable heat sink in order to prepare the said external surface repeatedly. The rolling device will further comprise a holder for the roller, so that the roller is rotatably mounted and movable with respect to the external surface, for example parallel to the axis of rotation of the movable heat sink and/or parallel to the external surface of the movable heat sink. In one embodiment, the rolling device can be pressed onto the external surface of the movable heat sink with a profiled or spherical roller having a diameter of less than 100 mm and with a contact force up to 1000 N. The contact force or surface pressure is typically less than the yield strength of the heat sink material to avoid a macroscopic, i.e. large-surface, displacement or deformation of the material. As stated above, the pressure which results in an adequate working of the external surface is determined by the material of the external surface as well as by the geometry of the rolling device or roller. In one embodiment, the roller is provided with a separate control for setting the speed of the roller. In this way, the speed of the roller of the rolling device can be adjusted independently of the speed of the heat sink. In a further embodiment, the device is designed such that the roller of the rolling device can be pressed against the external surface of the movable heat sink, so that it is, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,127 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textdriven by the movement of the heat sink. In this case, the roller does not have its own drive. The surface of the rotating roller is however pressed against the external surface of the rotating heat sink with a pressure which ensures that it works the external surface of the heat sink. In one embodiment, the roller of the rolling device has a first direction of rotation and the heat sink has a second direction of rotation, the first direction of rotation being opposed to the second direction of rotation. With this arrangement, the external surface of the movable heat sink is prepared in a rolling or roller-burnishing process. In one embodiment, the roller of the rolling device is movable across the external surface parallel to the second axis of rotation of the heat sink. With a movement in a direction which is parallel to the second axis of rotation, the external surface can be contacted and worked spirally. This offers the advantage that the external surface is not bent, so that the thickness of the strip remains the same across its width. In one embodiment, the device is further provided with a container for the melt to be poured. This container may be the container of a nozzle located immediately adjacent to the external surface, so that an opening from which the melt to be poured flows is arranged at a small distance from the external surface. The container or the device respectively may further comprise heating means to melt the melt material and/or to keep it in the molten state. The device may further comprise a receiving device for receiving the solidified strip. This receiving device may for example be a reel. A method for the production of a strip using a rapid solidification technology is also specified. A melt and a movable heat sink with an external surface are provided. The melt is poured onto the moving external surface of the moving heat sink and solidifies on the external surface while forming a strip. A rolling device is pressed against the external surface of the heat sink while the heat sink is in motion. The method is based on a rapid solidification technology in which the melt of a metal or alloy rapidly solidifies on contacting the external surface of the heat sink, while the heat sink and thus the external surface move fast. The melt is poured onto the external surface in a stream, so that a long strip is formed from the solidified metal or alloy owing to the movement of the heat sink. The external surface of the heat sink is roller-burnished by means of the rolling device while the heat sink and thus the external surface are in motion. This roller-burnishing can be carried out such that the external surface is worked while being smoothed. Roughness and irregularities in the external surface can be produced by the contact between the melt and the external surface. As the external surface repeatedly comes into contact with the melt, its quality is increasingly reduced as casting time increases. These irregularities can be, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,127 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textsmoothed with the rolling device, so that a smooth external surface is once again brought under the melt. As a result, the surface roughness of the bottom surface of the strip, which is formed as the melt solidifies on the external surface, can be kept more homogeneous over the length of the strip. In one embodiment, the rolling device is pressed against the external surface of the heat sink, so that it continuously contacts and works the external surface while the melt is poured onto the external surface of the heat sink. In this way, the surface on which the melt solidifies can be worked or smoothed. Owing to the working of the external surface, the roughness of the external surface is reduced after the contact with the rolling device compared to the roughness of the external surface before the contact with the rolling device. The rolling device is pressed against the moving external surface of the moving heat sink before the melt is poured onto the external surface. The rolling device is therefore placed downstream of the point where the melt hits the external contact surface. This enhances the uniformity of the external surface as well as of the underside of the rapidly solidified strip. In one embodiment, the rolling device comprises a rotatably mounted roller. The heat sink may be provided in the form of a rotatable wheel, the melt being poured onto the rim of the wheel. The roller of the rolling device may be arranged such that, together with the rim, it forms a rolling mill which works and smoothes the surface of the rim. If a rotatable roller is provided as a rolling device, this roller can be driven in a first direction of rotation, while the heat sink is driven in a second direction of rotation, the first direction of rotation being opposed to the second direction of rotation. Owing to the friction between the roller and the heat sink, the heat sink may drive the roller. This results in two opposed directions of rotation. As an alternative, the roller may be driven independently under its own control, and the device may include a separate control for setting the speed of the rotatable roller. In one embodiment, the roller is moved over the external surface parallel to the second axis of rotation of the heat sink while the heat sink is in motion, so that the external surface is contacted and worked spirally. This embodiment can be used in order to reduce irregularities across the overall width of the external surface. As an alternative, the roller may be moved parallel to the second axis of rotation of the heat sink, enabling it to contact a wider region of the external surface. This method can be used if the heat sink is designed such that two or more casting tracks are provided on the external surface. After the strip has been produced by rapid solidification on the external surface of the heat sink, it separates from the external surface owing to the shrinkage of the solidified melt and the movement of the external surface.

No. 62/926,708 filed on Oct. 28, 2019 and herewith incorporated in its entirety. TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to processes for reducing the contamination in a scandium concentrate using ion exchange resins. BACKGROUND Scandium (Sc) oxide products can be contaminated with metal contaminants which may, in some embodiments, be radioactive. Contamination, especially with radioactive metal contaminants, is problematic as it may limit the transport of the Sc oxide product and reduce its commercial value. It would be highly desirable to be provided with a process for reducing the contamination of metal contaminants in the Sc concentrate in order to make a Sc oxide product having a level of 500 ppm (or below) of metal contaminants. BRIEF SUMMARY The present disclosure concerns the use of a strong acid cationic resin (such as a sulfonate ion exchange resin) for reducing the contamination in a scandium concentrate. In a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a process for removing at least one metal contaminant from a scandium (Sc) concentrate. The process comprises contacting the Sc concentrate with an acidic solution so as to produce an impure Sc solution. In one embodiment of the process, the process comprises contacting the impure Sc solution with a first ion exchange resin capturing the at least one metal contaminant so as to produce a first ion exchange resin complex and a purified Sc raffinate solution, wherein the first ion exchange resin has more affinity for the at least one metal contaminant than for Sc and optionally eluting Sc from the first ion exchange resin complex with a first eluting solution to obtain a first Sc eluate and combining the first Sc eluate with the first Sc raffinate. In another embodiment of the process, the process also comprises contacting the impure Sc solution with a second ion exchange resin capturing the at least one metal contaminant and Sc so as to produce a second ion exchange resin complex; and eluting Sc from the second ion exchange resin complex with a second eluting solution so as to produce a purified Sc eluate. In the processes of the present disclosure, the concentration of the at least one metal contaminant in the purified Sc eluate or the purified Sc raffinate is lower than the concentration of the at least one metal contaminant in the impure Sc solution. Still in the processes of the present disclosure the first ion exchange resin and the second ion exchange resin are strong acid cationic resins with sulfonic acid functional groups in a potassium or sodium form. In an embodiment, the Sc concentrate is in a dry solid form or in an aqueous solid suspension or a slurry form. In yet another embodiment, the sulfonic acid functional groups are in the sodium form.

As used in the context of the present disclosure, the expression “scandium concentrate” refers to an amorphous (e.g., aqueous solid suspension or slurry) or a crystalline (e.g., dry solid form) scandium carbonate-bicarbonate-hydroxide precipitate. The precipitate can be obtained from processing scandium containing feed material such as liquid effluents and solid residues from titanium dioxide (TiO 2 2  2 3 In some embodiments, the scandium concentrate can be obtained by neutralizing a scandium carbonate solution from initial pH about 11.0 to final pH 6.5, with the addition of a strong acid, such as, for example, HCl. The scandium concentrate can be repulped and washed with deionized water, and optionally recovered by filtration. An embodiment of a process for obtaining a scandium concentrate is provided in WO2019/213753, herewith incorporated in its entirety. In the first step of the process, the Sc concentrate is treated with a strong acid, such as, for example, HCl, to achieve a solution (referred to herein as an impure Sc solution) having a pH between about 1.5 and 3.5 (and in some embodiments about between 3.0 and 3.5, or about 3.0). In an embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH of at least about 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, In another embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH of no more than about 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7 or 1.6. In a further embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH between about 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 and about 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7 or 1.6. In an embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH of at least about 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, In another embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH of no more than about 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2 or 3.1. In a further embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH between about 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 and about 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2 or 3.1. In still another embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a pH of about 3.0. In an embodiment, the impure Sc solution has a Sc concentration of about 1 to 20 g/L, and, in some embodiments, of about 1 to 10 g/L, 2 to 6 g/L or 4 to 5 g/L. The process of the present disclosure is designed to remove, at least in part, some of the metal contaminants from the Sc concentrate by treating an impure Sc solution.

In the present disclosure, it is preferred that the ion exchange resin includes potassium or sodium countercations. In a specific embodiment, the ion exchange resin of the present disclosure includes sodium countercations (e.g., in a resin in a sodium form). In some embodiments of the present disclosure, it is possible to use an ion exchange resin in the form of a gel. Gel resins generally have small pores (e.g., about 1 to 2 nm when hydrated). Embodiments of gel ion exchange resins which can be used in the context of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, Purolite PCR642™ or SSTC60™, Diaion UBK(8)™. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, it is possible to use an ion exchange resin in a macroporous form. Macroporous resins generally have large pores (e.g., about 20 to 100 nm when hydrated). Embodiments of macroporous ion exchange resins which can be used in the context of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, Purolite C150™ or PCR145K™. In the processes of the present disclosure, two different types of ion exchange resins can be used. In a first embodiment, the process uses a first ion exchange resin which preferentially captures the metal contaminant but not Sc (at least not in a substantive manner). In this first embodiment, the metal contaminant(s) forms a complex with the first ion exchange resin (e.g., a loaded resin or a second ion exchange resin complex). Furthermore, when the first ion exchange resin is used, a Sc raffinate is obtained. In this first aspect, since some Sc may be captured by the resin, it is possible to elute Sc from the first ion exchange resin complex (e.g., the loaded resin) to obtain a first Sc eluate which can optionally be combined with the Sc raffinate. In the first aspect of the process using a first ion exchange resin, a macroporous resin can be used. In a second embodiment, the process uses a second ion exchange resin which is capable of capturing and forming a complex with both the metal contaminant and the Sc present in the impure Sc solution. When the second ion exchange resin is used, it is necessary to elute the captured Sc from the resin to obtain a second Sc eluate. The elution step can be performed by contacting, for example, the second ion exchange resin complex (e.g., the loaded resin) with a second eluting solution. The person skilled art would know how to select an eluting solution suitable to obtain the second Sc eluate. In an embodiment, the eluting solution is a strong acid eluting solution, such as, for example, an HCl solution (for example a 1N HCl solution, a 2N HCl solution or a 3N HCl solution). In the second embodiment of the process using a first ion exchange resin, a macroporous or gel resin can be used. In the processes of the present disclosure, it is possible, once the Sc eluate and/or raffinate have been obtained, to regenerate the resin to undertake a new ion exchange cycle.

The person skilled art would know how to select an eluting solution suitable to remove, at least partially or the majority of, the captured metal contaminants. In an embodiment, the eluting solution is a strong acid eluting solution, such as, for example, an HCl solution (for example a 4N HCl solution, a 5N HCl solution, a 6N HCl solution, or a 8N HCl solution). The eluted metal contaminants may be further treated or discarded. The processes of the present disclosure can further include steps for generating a refined scandium oxide product.

No. 63/214,383 filed Jun. 24, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. BACKGROUND Metallic alloys containing one or more valuable elements are common. However, separation and purification of one or more of the elements in the alloy can be difficult or impossible. This can make recovery of certain elements from alloys in discarded materials impractical despite the high value and limited supply of certain elements. Advances in microelectronic devices has hinged on unique properties of critical materials albeit each geared towards a specific function in these highly complex systems. Critical materials include rare-earth elements, platinum-group elements, and other elements such as antimony, beryllium, cesium, cobalt, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, niobium, tantalum, tellurium, and tungsten. Challenges in continued improvements, however, have been exacerbated by a quasi-monopolistic supply coupled with limits to availability of high concentration mineable ore(s). Recycling and upcycling are, therefore, a critical pathway to sustainability albeit most recycling approaches rely on either wasteful chemical leaching or smelting. These methods are based on Gibbsian thermodynamics and are therefore costly, inefficient, and energy intensive. The classical nature of current methods renders them untenable in recovery of low concentration species. These methods are also not selective and cannot, therefore, be used to target a low concentration, but high value, component of an alloy or mixed material system. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method of separating one or more elements from an alloy. The method includes subjecting a metal alloy to a stimulus to form an enriched material including the one or more elements and to form a depleted material. The enriched material is enriched in the one or more elements compared to the alloy and the depleted material is depleted in the one or more elements compared to the alloy. The method also includes removing the enriched material and the depleted material from one another. The present invention provides a method of separating one or more elements from an alloy. The method includes subjecting a metal alloy to a stimulus including shearing a mixture including the alloy in a solvent to form an enriched material including the one or more elements and to form a depleted material. The enriched material is enriched in the one or more elements compared to the alloy and the depleted material is depleted in the one or more elements compared to the alloy. The method optionally includes solidifying the enriched material and/or the depleted material. The method also includes removing the enriched material and the depleted material from one another. The one or more elements include Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te,, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

By tuning oxidation via temperature, oxidant partial pressure, time and composition, a balance between reactivity and thermal deformation enables unprecedented morphologies. By trapping these features through solidification, we can stabilize them below the materials melting point. (1) Metals undergo extended multi-step oxidation processes with temperature. These stages are; i) the stochastic stoichiometric oxidation stage to create the first pre-Cabrera-Mott film, ii) the Cabrera-Mott regime, iii) the intermediate XRB regime, and iv) Wagner regime. All these stages depend on amount of existing oxide film except for the statistical mechanics driven initial state when the bare metal surface is exposed to the oxidant. (2) Despite changing mechanisms, we exploit these processes to selectively induce dealloying leading to speciation into the growing oxide and concomitant purification/isolation of the highest E O  O  Example 2. Use of Heat/Oxidation, Shearing, or Laser Irradiation to Separate One or More Elements from an Alloy As with the heating method described herein in Example 1, shearing and laser irradiation utilize differences in properties between elements to separate various elements from an alloy.

For the shearing process, the SLICE method was used with a BiGaIn alloy. Under extended period of shearing, the most reactive element (e.g., In) is continually be depleted, removing the element into the shearing solvent and shifting the alloy composition. The material was sheared for 10 minutes under a constant shear speed of 13000 rpm. Under an extended period of shearing, the most reactive component (In) was continually being depleted at a steady linear rate. Extreme shear speed also had an effect (at 17000 rpm) although it had a less significant effect than time, showing that this is a kinetic phenomena. Further proof of composition shifting was seen in a DSC plot as the melting point of the alloy with lower indium content had shifted by ˜20 degrees Celsius. An EDS map of the sheared BiGaIn alloy showed a very discreet alloy separation of eutecticBiGaIn under shear stress. This process relies on the miscibility of the components making the alloy. Gallium and indium are very miscible and create a very low energy eutectic alloy (EGaIn) whilst bismuth is not very miscible with the two. Shearing this alloy gives enough kinetic energy for these elements to scramble and form their low energy states. The formed particles are very distinct from each other (as seen in the EDS Map, and also from the distinct melting points of each respective resulting alloy). Heat/Oxidation-Based Separation.

For the photon reaction, the reactivity is dependent on different factors. Absorption coefficient defines how much light of a certain color is absorbed by the alloy. The higher numbers indicate that it will absorb higher wavelength colors (more red) and lower number indicate lower wavelength (more blue-purple). The reactivity of the electron configuration on certain elements depends on the polarizability. Elements such as bismuth and gold tend to have higher polarizability due to their tight electron configuration (lanthanide contraction, many overlapping accessible higher orbital states), thus under given photon energy supply, it is easier for these element to react. In the method, the particles are irradiated with a laser to alter the oxidation profile of the metal elements in the alloy.

The vacuum stream can also be fed into a u-tube glass including appropriate filters or porous media to trap the particles. In another example, the vacuumed particles can be passed over a charged surface allowing the particles to be electrostatically trapped onto the walls of the charged surface. Where the surface is curved (e.g., a curved tube), the particles will also be separated by size with the largest particles sticking to the tube early and the smallest running the furthest. The harvested plumes can also be passed through a gas bubbler containing a solution of an appropriate ligand, e.g., oleylamine, that stabilizes the particles and limits sintering.

No. 16/163,157, filed Oct. 17, 2018, which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 62/573,229, filed on Oct. 17, 2017. The disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present disclosure relates to a vacuum arc remelting system. BACKGROUND The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art. A vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process is generally used in the processing of high performance titanium, zirconium, nickel based alloys and steel, among other alloys. Generally, a VAR system gradually melts an electrode by an electric current that flows through the electrode and arcs to molten metal contained within a crucible. The applied melting current is varied during the process, to achieve the desired molten metal pool geometry. At times, the electric arc can cause beads of metal to spatter onto portions of the crucible wall that are above the molten metal. These portions are cold and can solidify the beads into a porous nonhomogeneous mass, which can cause surface irregularities in the ingot. Issues related to VAR ingot surface quality and internal quality, and other issues are addressed by the present disclosure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. To address the surface irregularities of the formed ingot, a VAR system may include large stationary coils in a Helmholtz configuration that are arranged around a crucible. The stationary coils extend along the entire length of the crucible and are used to generate a transverse magnetic field. Such VAR system is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,745 which is commonly assigned with the present application and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. While the VAR system having the Helmholtz configured coils may reduce surface irregularities, the coils have to be placed a significant distance away from the crucible. In addition, due to their large size, the coils require more power to generate the required magnetic field. Generally, a VAR system of the present disclosure includes an electromagnetic energy source and a lift mechanism for moving the electromagnetic energy source with the growing molten metal (i.e., ingot), such that the magnetic field is localized. In one form, the electromagnetic energy source is a compact coil assembly, and as described further herein, in one form, the coil assembly includes a ring shaped magnetic core, made up of a high permeability material and wound with insulated wires. The coil assembly is operable to generate a rotating magnetic field that is perpendicular to the normal axis of the coil assembly. This rotating magnetic field generated interacts with the melting current to move the arc radially in a direction perpendicular to the normal axis of the electrode and ingot. Although the lift mechanism is illustrated and described as moving the electromagnetic energy source relative to the ingot, it should also be understood that the ingot may be moved relative to the electromagnetic energy source, or both the electromagnetic energy source and the ingot may move while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. One form of the VAR system of the present disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,191 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to the general field of recycling of lithium batteries and more particularly to recycling of Li-ion type batteries. The invention relates to a recycling method allowing selectively extracting cobalt and/or manganese from a solution further containing lithium ions. The invention is particularly interesting since the efficiency of extraction of these elements is very high. PRIOR ART The market of lithium, in particular Li-ion type, accumulators (or batteries) is currently growing in particular with nomadic applications (“smartphone”, portable electric tooling...) and with the emergence and development of electric and hybrid vehicles. Lithium-ion accumulators comprise an anode, a cathode, a separator, an electrolyte and a casing which may consist of a polymer pouch, or a metallic packaging. In general, the negative electrode is made of graphite mixed with a PVDF type binder deposited over a copper sheet. The positive electrode is a lithium-ion insertion material (for example, LiCoO 2 2 3 6 4 6 4 4 The operation is as follows: during charging, lithium is detached from the active material of the positive electrode and fits into the active material of the negative electrode. During discharge, the process is reversed. Given the environmental, economic and strategic challenges in the supply of some metals present in batteries, it is necessary to recycle 50% of the materials contained in Li-ion cells and accumulators (2006/66/EC directive). In particular, it consists in valorising copper, cobalt, nickel and lithium. Currently, to recover the valuable elements, industrials generally use a combination of physical, thermal and chemical methods. For example, the physical methods consist in dismantling, crushing and sieving the batteries. The thermal methods are based on pyrometallurgical processes consisting in heating the residues at high temperature to separate the metals in the form of slags or alloys. However, these thermal methods are energy-expensive because they need temperatures that could reach 1400° C. While being very efficient to separate cobalt, nickel and copper, they do not allow recovering manganese and lithium. The chemical methods are used to recover the valuable elements in a pure form. These consist of hydrometallurgical processes implementing reagent in a liquid phase to dissolve and/or make the metals precipitate. The conventional lixiviation uses highly concentrated acids. The separation could be achieved by various chemical methods and reagents. For example, in the document WO 2005/101564 A1, cells and batteries are subjected to a hydrometallurgical treatment process. The process comprises the following steps: dry crushing, at room temperature, in an inert atmosphere, then a treatment by magnetic separation and densimetric table, and aqueous hydrolysis, in order to recover lithium, for example in the form of carbonate. The fine fraction freed from soluble lithium and including the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

After purification, cobalt is recovered by precipitation by adding sodium hypochlorite, with the regulation of pH at a value comprised between 2.3 and 2.8. This method is used for a solution rich in cobalt (>98%) and with a very low manganese concentration (<2%). For a solution that is rich in both cobalt and manganese, an electrolysis is carried out at a temperature of 55° C. under a current density comprised between 400 and 600 A/m 2 However, the use of hypochlorite is harmful for the plants, safety and therefore the cost of the process. In addition, it is necessary to know the manganese concentration in order to select the suitable process. In the document EP 2 532 759 A1, the method for recovering metals from crushings of lithium batteries or of elements of lithium batteries comprising the following steps: lixiviation of the crushings in an acid medium so as to obtain a solution containing metal ions, separation of the metal ions from the obtained solution on a first cation-exchange resin, preferably on a sulfonic resin, to obtain a solution of lithium ions, a nickel, cobalt and/or manganese solution, and a last solution of aluminium ions, separation of the solution of nickel and cobalt and manganese ions on a second cation-exchange resin so as to obtain a solution of nickel and cobalt ions, and a solution of manganese ions. For example, the elution of the nickel and cobalt ions is carried out with a solution complexing the nickel and/or cobalt ions, for example with aminopolycarboxylic acid. For example, the elution of the manganese ions is carried out with a mineral acid at a concentration of 2N to 4N. However, ion-exchange resins are relatively expensive, and need to be regenerated. Their use generates much effluents, significant treatment times and a considerable acid consumption. In the document US 2019/0152797 A1, a method allowing recovering nickel, manganese, lithium sulphates and cobalt oxides from the battery wastes. The method consists in dissolving battery wastes with acid, iron and aluminium are then retrieved and then calcium, magnesium and copper are retrieved. The separation steps are based on extraction by a solvent and crystallisation by evaporation. The recovered products have a high purity. However, the extraction by solvent (or liquid/liquid extraction) requires for each element several steps (extraction in the organic solvent, de-extraction of the organic solvent, crystallisation) and therefore involves many products such as kerosene, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Such a method is long to implement and generates a considerable amount of effluents, it is therefore difficult to industrialise, from an economic and environmental perspective.

According to a first variant, the peroxymonosulfate salt may be introduced in a liquid form. For example, it is solubilised beforehand in water. It has the advantage of being very soluble in water (250 g/L), which reduces the amount of effluents derived from the process. According to a second variant, the peroxymonosulfate salt is introduced in a solid form in the solution to be treated. This avoids adding an aqueous solvent in the solution to be treated. Advantageously, the peroxymonosulfate salt is introduced with a flow rate ranging from 0.1 g per minute per litre of solution (g/min/L solution solution  solution Preferably, the manganese extraction (manganese removal) step is carried out with a solution containing both cobalt ions and nickel ions.

During a first step, the waste is dissolved in a sulfuric acid solution with a solid-on-liquid ratio of 15%. The dissolution is carried out at room temperature in 5L of water. The pH is set at 2 thanks to a system for servo-controlling pH which continuously injects sulfuric acid. Afterwards, the medium is left under stirring for one hour. Stirring is ensured at a speed of 400 rpm by a “4 winged” type blade, equipped with a scraper to prevent particle agglomeration. After dissolution, the pH is raised to 5 with solid sodium carbonate, then 0.35% by volume of hydrogen peroxide (30%) is added, which corresponds to stoichiometric equivalence with respect to iron remaining in the solution. After a stabilisation period of about 30 minutes, the mixture is filtered. A filtrate rich in Li, Ni, Mn and Co and a solid, rich in C, Cu, Fe and Al, are recovered.

BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present specification discloses a manufacturing method of a porous silicon material, a porous silicon material, and a power storage device. 2. Description of Related Art Conventionally, as a negative electrode material of silicon, porous silicon has been suggested which is obtained by mixing 70 parts by mass of Si lumps with 30 parts by mass of Al powder, then making the mixture into a molten alloy in an argon atmosphere, making the alloy into particles by a gas atomization method using a helium gas, and then removing Al by using hydrochloric acid (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-214054 (JP 2004-214054 A)). According to JP 2004-214054 A, the porous silicon makes it possible to completely suppress micronization resulting from the volumetric expansion and contraction of an active material during charge and discharge, peeling of the active material from a current collector, and lack of contact with a conductive material. As a manufacturing method of a silicon material, a method has been suggested which includes separating a Si alloy composed of Si and an intermediate alloy element including Mg, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, or the like into Si fine particles and a second phase formed by the substitution of the intermediate alloy element with a molten element in a molten metal containing a predetermined molten element and removing the second phase to obtain a porous silicon material (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-82125 (JP 2012-82125 A)). According to JP 2012-82125 A, with the porous silicon material, a high capacity and high cycle characteristics can be obtained. SUMMARY However, using an alloy having a Si content of 50% by mass or more, the manufacturing method in JP 2004-214054 A is not effective enough to reduce the problem resulting from the expansion and contraction of Si. In the manufacturing method of a porous silicon material in JP 2012-82125 A, the silicon alloy containing the intermediate alloy element needs to be melted and substituted in a molten metal containing a predetermined molten element, that is, the silicon alloy needs to be treated at a high temperature, which necessitates a simple manufacturing process. The present disclosure has been made in consideration of the above problems, and the main object of the present disclosure is to provide a manufacturing method of a porous silicon material that can further improve electrochemical characteristics, a porous silicon material, and a power storage device. As a result of carrying out intensive studies to achieve the aforementioned object, the inventors of the present disclosure have found that preparing a silicon alloy containing Al at a mixing ratio close to that in a eutectic, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In the particle forming step, a treatment of making a silicon alloy containing Al as a first element and Si into particles is performed. In the pore forming step, a treatment of removing the first element from the silicon alloy to obtain a porous material is performed. In the heat treatment step, a treatment of heating the porous material to diffuse elements other than Si to a surface of the porous material is performed. Particle Forming Step In the particle forming step, a silicon alloy is used in which the content of the first element is in a range of 50% by mass or more and the content of Si is in a range of 50% by mass or less. Examples of the first element include Al. Examples of raw materials used in the particle forming step include a Si metal and an Al metal. The content of the first element in the silicon alloy used in the particle forming step is, in embodiments, in a range of 60% by mass or more and, in some embodiments, in a range of 70% by mass or more, or may be in a range of 80% by mass or more. The content of the first element in the silicon alloy used in the particle forming step is, in embodiments, in a range of 92% by mass or less and, in some embodiments, in a range of 90% by mass or less, or may be in a range of 85% by mass or less. The silicon alloy in which the content of the first element is in the range may be used in embodiments because the silicon alloy can further increase porosity and makes it possible to obtain voids having more suitable shape and size. In a case where the content of the first element is 92% by mass or less, the silicon skeleton can be maintained. In a case where the content of the first element is 50% by mass or more, the porosity can be further increased. In a case where the content of Al is high, a single phase of Al is precipitated much after the silicon alloy is made into an alloy by melting and then rapidly cooled. Accordingly, many voids can be formed. In the particle forming step, a silicon alloy in which the content of the first element is in a range capable of forming a eutectic composition may be used. The eutectic composition contains 87.6% by mass of Al and 12.6% by mass of Si. However, the silicon alloy may be close to the eutectic composition, or may cover a predetermined range, such as a part of a hypoeutectic or hypereutectic composition.

Examples of the substances other than Si include Al as the first element or an Al compound and the second element or a compound of the second element. In the pore forming step, an acid or alkali may be used to selectively remove Al as the first element or an Al compound or remove the second element or a compound of the second element. The acid or alkali to be used may be a substance that elutes elements and/or compounds other than silicon in the silicon alloy but does not elute silicon. Examples of the acid or alkali include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and sodium hydroxide. The acid or alkali may be an aqueous solution, in embodiments. The concentration of the acid or alkali is not particularly limited as long as Al as the first element or an Al compound and the second element or a compound of the second element can be removed. For example, the concentration of the acid or alkali can be in a range of 1 mol/L or more and 5 mol/L or less. The removal treatment may be performed by heating at, for example, 20° C. to 60° C. In the removal treatment, the silicon alloy particles may be immersed in an acid or alkali solution and the solution may be stirred for about 1 hour to 5 hours. The obtained porous silicon material is then washed and dried. In the pore forming step, the amount of substances other than Si to be removed may be in a range of 85% by mass or more and 100% by mass or less. For example, it does not matter even though the first or second element and oxygen other than the first and second elements may remain. However, because these are components unnecessary for the porous silicon material, the amount of these be smaller, in embodiments. The pore forming step may also be a step of obtaining a porous silicon material having an average porosity in a range of 50% by volume or more and 95% by volume or less. The average porosity is a value measured by a mercury porosimeter. Heat Treatment Step In the heat treatment step, a treatment of heating the porous material obtained by the pore forming step to diffuse elements other than Si to the surface of the porous material is performed. In the heat treatment step, the porous material may be heated at a temperature in a range of 400° C. or higher and 1,100° C. or lower. In this temperature range, at a temperature of 400° C. or higher, Al that is present as a solid solution in the silicon skeleton is precipitated. Presumably, at a temperature of 600° C. or higher, the precipitated Al may diffuse on the surface. In addition, presumably, at a temperature of 800° C. or higher, Al having diffused on the surface of the silicon skeleton may form an oxide and strengthen the silicon skeleton. In embodiments, in the heat treatment step, the first element having diffused on the surface may be oxidized and the surface of the silicon skeleton may, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The electrode for the power storage device may be an electrode compressed, so that the average porosity of the porous silicon material falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less. The electrode may be compressed when prepared, so that the porosity of the porous silicon material is reduced. Compared to the porous silicon material prepared as a material having a porosity in a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less, a porous silicon material that is prepared as a material having a porosity of 50% by volume or more and 95% or less and then compressed, so that the porosity falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less exhibits better charge and discharge characteristics due to the shape of voids and the like. For example, when porous silicon particles are used as a negative electrode active material of a lithium ion secondary battery, the smaller the pores, the more uniform the obtained alloy when lithium ions take part in alloying. Therefore, stress concentration is reduced, which makes it possible to prevent the deterioration of the electrode. The average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be appropriately adjusted depending on the characteristics that the electrode for the power storage device needs to have. For example, the average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be 10% by volume or more or 20% by volume or more. The average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be, for example, 40% by volume or less or 30% by volume or less. The electrode for the power storage device may be an electrode including a current collector and the aforementioned porous silicon material that is formed and fixed on the current collector. The electrode can be prepared by a step of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder and a solvent as needed and making the mixture into a paste or a step of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder as needed and bonding the mixture to a current collector under pressure. In embodiments, the content of the porous silicon material in the electrode may be higher. The content of the porous silicon material in the electrode is, in embodiments, 70% by mass or more, in embodiments, 80% by mass or more, and, in embodiments, 85% by mass or more.

Manufacturing Method of Electrode for Power Storage Device The manufacturing method of an electrode for a power storage device includes a pressing step of compressing a porous silicon material obtained by the aforementioned manufacturing method of a porous silicon material as an electrode active material, so that the average porosity of the porous silicon material falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less. The pressing step makes it possible to reduce porosity while maintaining a suitable pore shape and to further increase energy density. In the pressing step, the porous silicon material may be compressed, so that the average porosity thereof falls into a range of 10% by volume or more or 20% by volume or more, and a range of 40% by volume or less or 30% by volume or less. The average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be appropriately adjusted depending on the characteristics that the electrode for the power storage device needs to have. In the pressing step, for example, the electrode may be pressed under a pressure in a range of 2 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less. The pressing step may be a step of performing a treatment of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder and a solvent as needed and making the mixture into a paste or a treatment of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder as needed and bonding the mixture to a current collector under pressure. As for the amount of the porous silicon material to be mixed in and the like, what are described above regarding the electrode for the power storage device can be appropriately employed. Manufacturing Method of Power Storage Device The manufacturing method of a power storage device may be a method of using an electrode for a power storage device obtained by the aforementioned manufacturing method of an electrode for a power storage device as a negative electrode, disposing a positive electrode and the negative electrode to make the electrodes face each other, and interposing an ion conducting medium conducting lithium ions between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. A separator may be interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. As the positive electrode, the negative electrode, the ion conducting medium, and the separator, it is possible to appropriately use any of those exemplified above for the aforementioned power storage device.

The thickness or size of the positive electrode, the negative electrode, and the solid electrolyte used in the manufacturing method can be appropriately selected depending on the desired battery characteristics. In the manufacturing method, the pressing step in the manufacturing method of an electrode for a power storage device may be performed in the laminate preparation step. That is, in the step of pressing the laminate composed of the positive electrode, the solid electrolyte, and the negative electrode laminated on each other, the negative electrode may be pressed as well. The manufacturing method of an all-solid-state lithium-ion secondary battery may further include a laminate restraining step of restraining the prepared laminate with a restraining member in the lamination direction. The restraining pressure for the laminate is, in embodiments, in a range of, for example, 2 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less. As being specifically described above, the present disclosure can further improve the electrochemical characteristics of materials containing Si. The reason why such an effect is obtained is presumed as follows. For example, in a lithium ion secondary battery, a silicon electrode has a theoretical capacity of 4,199 mAh/g, which is about 10 times higher than theoretical capacity, 372 mAh/g, of general graphite. Therefore, the silicon electrode is expected to further increase capacity and energy density. Meanwhile, silicon having absorbed lithium ions is Li 4.4 Note that the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described above. It goes without saying that the present disclosure can be embodied in various aspects as long as the aspects are within the technical scope of the present disclosure.

No. 17/273,149 filed on Mar. 3, 2021, which is the U.S. National Stage of PCT/FR2019/052091, filed on Sep. 10, 2019, which in turn claims priority to French patent application number 1858208 filed on Sep. 13, 2018. The content of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties FIELD The present invention relates to a metal alloy for use at very high temperature, in particular which can be used in a process for manufacturing mineral wool by fiberizing a molten mineral composition, or more generally for the formation of tools with mechanical strength at high temperature in an oxidizing environment, such as molten glass, and to nickel-based alloys which can be used at high temperature, especially for the manufacture of articles for the smelting and/or hot conversion of glass or other mineral material, such as components of machines for the manufacture of mineral wool. SUMMARY One fiberizing technique, known as by internal centrifugation, consists in allowing liquid glass to fall continuously inside an assembly of axisymmetric parts rotating at a very high rotational speed around their vertical axis. One key part, known as “spinner”, receives the glass against a wall referred to as “band” pierced with holes through which the glass passes under the effect of the centrifugal force in order to escape from all parts thereof in the form of molten filaments. An annular burner located above the outside of the spinner, which produces a descending gas stream tightly surrounding the external wall of the band, deflects these filaments downward, drawing them. Said filaments subsequently “solidify” in the form of glass wool. The spinner is a fiberizing tool which is highly stressed thermally (heat shocks during startup and shutdown operations, and establishment, in stabilized use, of a temperature gradient along the part), mechanically (centrifugal force, erosion due to the passage of the glass) and chemically (oxidation and corrosion by the molten glass, and by the hot gases emerging from the burner around the spinner). Its main modes of deterioration are: hot creep deformation of the vertical walls, the appearance of horizontal or vertical cracks and wear by erosion of the fiberizing orifices, which require the outright replacement of the components. Their constituent material must thus resist for a sufficiently long production time (or fiberizing time) to remain compatible with the technical and economic constraints of the process. To this end, materials having a degree of ductility, creep resistance and resistance to corrosion by molten glass and to oxidation at high temperature are sought. Nickel-based superalloys reinforced by precipitation of carbides are known for the production of these tools. FR 2675818 describes such alloys, for example.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,248 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textDETAILED DESCRIPTION For the purposes of the present invention, unavoidable impurities is intended to mean that the elements in question are not intentionally present in the composition of the alloy but that they are introduced in the form of impurities present in at least one of the main elements of the alloy (or in at least one of the precursors of said main elements). The alloy according to the present invention differs from the nickel-based alloys generally used for such applications especially in that it contains niobium carbides (NbC) and optionally titanium carbides (TiC), and also a limited amount of iron, or even no iron, or iron solely in the form of unavoidable impurities. Patent application FR2675818, cited above, indicates that an amount of iron of between 7 and 10% in nickel-based alloys is necessary in order to improve the resistance to corrosion with regard to the molten glass, especially with regard to the sulfur-containing compounds contained in said molten glass. Unexpectedly, and even counter to what could be expected, the properties of the alloy compositions according to the present invention, that is to say having a proportion of iron much lower than that previously described (or even having no iron or iron solely in the form of unavoidable impurities) appeared superior to those of the alloys of the prior art and in particular, the lifetime of the spinners made from such an alloy proved to be greater, as will be demonstrated in the remainder of the description by the examples provided. Among the elements forming part of the composition of the alloy, mention may especially be made of (all the percentages being given relative to the total weight of the alloy): Nickel is the base element of the alloys according to the invention, in that it represents more than 50% by weight of the alloy. The nickel content is preferably greater than or equal to 52%, or even greater than or equal to 54%. More preferably still, the nickel content is greater than 55%, or even greater than or equal to 56%. More preferably still, the nickel content is less than or equal to 65%, or even less than or equal to 63%, or even less than or equal to 62%. The alloy may very preferentially comprise a range of between 55.5 and 60% by weight of nickel, or even between 56 and 60% by weight of nickel. Carbon is an essential constituent of the alloy, necessary for formation of metal carbide precipitates. In particular, the carbon content directly determines the amount of carbides present in the alloy. It is at least 0.4% by weight, in order to obtain the desired minimum reinforcement, preferably at least 0.5% by weight, but preferentially limited to at most 1% by weight, preferably of at most 0.9% by weight, or even at most 0.8% by weight, in order to prevent the alloy from becoming hard and difficult to machine due to an excessively high density of reinforcements. The lack of ductility of the alloy at such contents prevents it from accommodating, without, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The alloy may very preferentially comprise a range of between 0.6 and 0.7% by weight of carbon. Most particularly, an alloy according to the invention that has demonstrated very good performance in the meaning described previously comprises between 0.55 and 1% by weight of carbon. Chromium contributes to the intrinsic mechanical strength of the matrix in which it is present partly in solid solution and, in some cases, also in the form of carbides essentially of Cr 23 6  7 3  23 6  The alloy may very preferentially comprise a range of between 28 and 30% by weight of chromium. According to the experiments carried out by the applicant company, niobium, like titanium, appears to contribute to the mechanical strength of the alloy, in particular to the creep resistance, at high temperature, for example greater than 1000° C., or even greater than 1040° C. This is because chromium carbides have a tendency to dissolve at temperatures of greater than 1000° C. The presence of niobium carbides and titanium carbides, which are more stable than chromium carbides at high temperature, makes it possible to ensure the mechanical strength of the alloy at high temperature. Moreover, the migration of the chromium at the surface to form the protective chromine layer required for the corrosion resistance induces a local decrease in the chromium at the subsurface and therefore a disappearance of the carbides Cr 7 3  23 6 The alloy may very preferentially comprise a range of between 0.8 and 1.2% by weight of niobium. A certain proportion of titanium may also contribute to the mechanical strength of the alloy at high temperature by the formation of titanium carbides. However, it has been noted that the presence of titanium could affect the resistance to oxidation of the alloy. Thus, the titanium content is preferably less than 0.5%, or even less than 0.4% by weight. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the alloy does not comprise titanium other than in the form of unavoidable impurity, that is to say at contents of less than 0.1%, or even of less than 0.05% or even of less than 0.01% by weight of the alloy. The (Nb+Ti)/C weight ratio according to the invention is preferably between 1 and 2, more preferentially between 1.5 and 2. The (Nb+Ti)/C weight ratio according to the invention is in particular between 1.5 and 2.4. Tungsten also contributes, together with the other metals present in the alloy and mentioned previously, to the hardness of the alloy and to its creep resistance. Tungsten is present in an amount greater than or equal to 3%, more preferably still greater than or equal to 4%, or even greater than or equal to 5% by weight of the alloy. Tungsten is preferably present in an amount less than or equal to 7%, more preferably still less than or equal to 6% by weight of the alloy. The alloy may comprise for example from 3 to 8%,, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,248 - WARNING - An error occurred: input text4 to 7%, and very preferentially between 5 and 6% by weight of tungsten. Cobalt may be present in the alloy in the form of a solid solution with nickel. It is very commonly used in the field of high temperature refractory steels in refractory alloys because it is known that such a solid solution contributes to the corrosion resistance and the mechanical strength of the overall alloy. However, as cobalt is an expensive element, it is deliberately limited according to the invention and present in an amount of less than 3%, or even less than 2%, or even less than 1% by weight of the alloy. Surprisingly, although the presence of a sufficient amount of cobalt is considered to be a requirement in the field of refractory alloys comprising nickel in order to stabilize the latter, it has been found by the applicant company that, in the specific case of the alloy which is the subject of the present invention, it is possible to limit its presence as far as possible, in particular to limit its presence solely in the form of unavoidable impurities. Most generally, the tests carried out by the applicant showed that the cobalt was nonetheless virtually always present in the alloy in the form of unavoidable impurity at an amount of at least 0.3% by weight and most commonly at least 0.5% by weight, or even at least 0.7% by weight. Percentages of cobalt in the alloy of less than 0.3% by weight, or even less than the detection thresholds, must however also be considered as being included in the context of the invention. As indicated above, the amount of iron, considered to be an essential element in the prior art document FR2675818, is also limited in the present invention. The iron content is preferably less than or equal to 5%, or even less than or equal to 4.5%, or even less than or equal to 4%. According to one embodiment of the invention, the iron content is greater than or equal to 1%, or even greater than or equal to 2%, or even greater than or equal to 3%. According to another embodiment of the invention, the iron may only be present in the form of unavoidable impurities. According to another possible embodiment, the iron content is between 4% and 6% by weight. The alloy may advantageously contain other elements in very minor proportions. It comprises in particular:, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The cumulative amount of the other elements introduced as impurities with the essential constituents of the alloy (“unavoidable impurities”) advantageously represents less than 2% by weight of the composition of the alloy, or even less than 1% by weight of the alloy. Among the possible, and common, unavoidable impurities, mention may be made of sulfur or phosphorus. The individual amount thereof generally does not exceed 0.05% in the alloys according to the invention. The alloy according to the present invention also differs from certain nickel-based alloys generally used for the manufacture of fiberizing spinners in that it does not contain aluminum other than in the form of unavoidable impurity, that is to say at contents of less than 0.1%, or even less than 0.05%, or even less than 0.01% by weight. This is because it has been noted that the presence of aluminum in the alloy, even at a low amount of the order of 0.1% by weight, could significantly affect its corrosion resistance with regard to the molten glass. The alloy according to the invention is also devoid of molybdenum, apart from in the form of unavoidable impurity, that is to say that it may comprise contents of less than 0.1%, or even of less than 0.05% or even of less than 0.01% by weight of molybdenum. This is because, although molybdenum is known to provide nickel-based alloys with excellent corrosion resistance, it has been observed that, even at low contents, molybdenum could considerably affect their resistance to oxidation. In a particular embodiment, the alloy according to the invention comprises, as percentage by weight:

The casting can optionally be followed by a heat treatment. Another subject of the invention is a process for the manufacture of an article by founding, using the alloys described above as subject of the invention. The process generally comprises a step of appropriate heat treatment which makes it possible to obtain secondary carbides and makes possible their homogeneous distribution in the metal matrix, as described in FR 2675818. The heat treatment is preferably carried out at a temperature of less than 1000° C., or even of less than 950° C., for example from 800° C. to 900° C., for a period of at least 5 hours, or even at least 8 hours, for example from 10 to 20 hours. The process may comprise at least one cooling stage, after the casting and/or after or in the course of a heat treatment, for example by cooling in the air, in particular with a return to ambient temperature. The alloys which are subjects of the invention can be used to manufacture all kinds of parts which are mechanically stressed at high temperature and/or caused to operate in an oxidizing or corrosive environment. Other subjects of the invention are such articles manufactured from an alloy according to the invention, especially by founding. Mention may especially be made, among such applications, of the manufacture of articles which can be used for the smelting or the hot conversion of glass, for example fiberizing spinners for the manufacture of mineral wool. Thus, another subject of the invention is a process for manufacturing mineral wool by internal centrifugation, in which a flow of molten mineral material is poured into a fiberizing spinner, the peripheral band of which is pierced with a multitude of orifices through which filaments of molten mineral material escape and are subsequently drawn to give wool under the action of a gas, the temperature of the mineral material in the spinner being at least 900° C., or even at least 950° C. or at least 1000° C., or even at least 1040° C., and the fiberizing spinner consisting of an alloy as defined above. The alloys according to the invention therefore make it possible to fiberize a molten mineral material having a liquidus temperature (T liq The composition of the mineral material to be fiberized is not particularly limited as long as it can be fiberized by an internal centrifugation process. It can vary as a function of the properties desired for the mineral fibers produced, for example biosolubility, fire resistance or thermal insulation properties.

 The material to be fiberized can be prepared from pure constituents but it is generally obtained by melting a mixture of natural starting materials that provide different impurities. Although the invention has been described mainly in the context of the manufacture of mineral wool, it can be applied to the glass industry in general for producing furnace, bushing or feeder components or fittings, in particular for the production of yarns of textile glass, of packaging glass, and the like. Outside the glass industry, the invention can be applied to the manufacture of a very wide variety of articles, when the latter must have high mechanical strength in an oxidizing and/or corrosive environment, in particular at high temperature. The examples which follow, which are in no way restrictive of the compositions according to the invention or of the conditions for employing the fiberizing spinners according to the invention, illustrate the advantages of the present invention. EXAMPLES A molten charge of a composition I1 (according to the invention) and C1 (according to FR 2675818) which are indicated in table 1 is prepared by the inductive melting technique under an inert atmosphere (in particular argon), which molten charge is subsequently formed by simple casting in a sand mold.

The casting is followed by a heat treatment of 12 hours at 865° C. for precipitation of the secondary carbides. This treatment is followed by quenching with blown air. In this way, series of fiberizing spinners of diameter 400 mm and 600 mm are manufactured in the two alloys.

Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to a sliding element, such as a bearing, bushing, or washer formed of an aluminum alloy material, and a method of manufacturing the same. 2. Related Art Internal combustion engines typically include sliding elements, such as bearings, bushings, or washers, to support rotating shafts and allow them to rotate more smoothly and with less friction. Existing bearings formed of aluminum alloy materials typically contain tin to provide a soft phase that improves sliding properties, conformability, and embeddability. However, tin is expensive and can lead to numerous challenges related to quality and processing. The amount of tin in an aluminum alloy material for a bearing is typically limited to less than 10 weight percent (wt. %) in roll cast and hot bonded aluminum alloy materials. Zinc is another element that can provide a soft phase in an aluminum alloy material. However, the use of zinc in current aluminum alloy materials is limited. The amount of zinc present in aluminum alloy materials for bearings is typically limited to about 5 weight percent, as the zinc causes hardening and strengthening of the alloy that is unsuitable for a bearing application. In addition, zinc is more soluble in aluminum at engine operating temperatures compared to tin, which limits is ability to improve embeddability. Silicon is also oftentimes added to aluminum alloy materials for bearings, such as materials containing tin or zinc, to form a hard phase which provides wear resistance and prevents seizure. However, the aluminum alloy material must be heat treated to confer the appropriate size and distribution of the hard silicon phase. SUMMARY One aspect of the invention provides a sliding element, such as a bearing for an internal combustion engine, which overcomes many of the challenges described above. The sliding element includes an aluminum alloy material.

Typically, the zinc is in an amount of greater than 5 wt. % or at least 10 wt. %, based on the total weight of the aluminum alloy material. The method further includes heat treating the cast aluminum alloy material at a temperature of 100° C. to 275° C. for at least 5 hours to form a soft phase consisting essentially of the zinc.

BACKGROUND Polycrystalline superhard materials, such as polycrystalline diamond (PCD) and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) may be used in a wide variety of tools for cutting, machining, drilling or degrading hard or abrasive materials such as rock, metal, ceramics, composites and wood-containing materials. In particular, tool inserts in the form of cutting elements comprising PCD material are widely used in drill bits for boring into the earth to extract oil or gas. The working life of super hard tool inserts may be limited by fracture of the super hard material, including by spalling and chipping, or by wear of the tool insert. Cutting elements such as those for use in rock drill bits or other cutting tools typically have a body in the form of a substrate which has an interface end/surface and a super hard material which forms a cutting layer bonded to the interface surface of the substrate by, for example, a sintering process. The substrate is generally formed of a tungsten carbide-cobalt alloy, sometimes referred to as cemented tungsten carbide and the super hard material layer is typically polycrystalline diamond (PCD), polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) or a thermally stable product TSP material such as thermally stable polycrystalline diamond. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is an example of a superhard material (also called a superabrasive material or ultra hard material) comprising a mass of substantially inter-grown diamond grains, forming a skeletal mass defining interstices between the diamond grains. PCD material typically comprises at least about 80 volume % of diamond and is conventionally made by subjecting an aggregated mass of diamond grains to an ultra-high pressure of greater than about 5 GPa, and temperature of at least about 1,200° C., for example. A material wholly or partly filling the interstices may be referred to as filler or binder material. PCD is typically formed in the presence of a sintering aid such as cobalt, which promotes the inter-growth of diamond grains. Suitable sintering aids for PCD are also commonly referred to as a solvent-catalyst material for diamond, owing to their function of dissolving, to some extent, the diamond and catalysing its re-precipitation. A solvent-catalyst for diamond is understood be a material that is capable of promoting the growth of diamond or the direct diamond-to-diamond inter-growth between diamond grains at a pressure and temperature condition at which diamond is thermodynamically stable. Consequently the interstices within the sintered PCD product may be wholly or partially filled with residual, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Most typically, PCD is often formed on a cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide substrate, which provides a source of cobalt solvent-catalyst for the PCD. Materials that do not promote substantial coherent intergrowth between the diamond grains may themselves form strong bonds with diamond grains, but are not suitable solvent-catalysts for PCD sintering. Cemented tungsten carbide which may be used to form a suitable substrate is formed from carbide particles being dispersed in a cobalt matrix by mixing tungsten carbide particles/grains and cobalt together then heating to solidify. To form the cutting element with a superhard material layer such as PCD or PCBN, diamond particles or grains or CBN grains are placed adjacent the cemented tungsten carbide body in a refractory metal enclosure such as a niobium enclosure and are subjected to high pressure and high temperature so that inter-grain bonding between the diamond grains or CBN grains occurs, forming a polycrystalline superhard diamond or polycrystalline CBN layer. In some instances, the substrate may be fully cured prior to attachment to the superhard material layer whereas in other cases, the substrate may be green, that is, not fully cured. In the latter case, the substrate may fully cure during the HTHP sintering process. The substrate may be in powder form and may solidify during the sintering process used to sinter the superhard material layer. Ever increasing drives for improved productivity in the earth boring field place ever increasing demands on the materials used for cutting rock. Specifically, PCD materials with improved abrasion and impact resistance are required to achieve faster cut rates and longer tool life. Cutting elements or tool inserts comprising PCD material are widely used in drill bits for boring into the earth in the oil and gas drilling industry. Rock drilling and other operations require high abrasion resistance and impact resistance. One of the factors limiting the success of the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) abrasive cutters is the generation of heat due to friction between the PCD and the work material. This heat causes the thermal degradation of the diamond layer. The thermal degradation increases the wear rate of the cutter through increased cracking and spelling of the PCD layer as well as back conversion of the diamond to graphite causing increased abrasive wear. Methods used to improve the abrasion resistance of a PCD composite often result in a decrease in impact resistance of the composite. The most wear resistant grades of PCD usually suffer from a catastrophic fracture of the cutter before it has worn out. During the use of these cutters, cracks grow until they reach a critical length as which catastrophic failure occurs, namely, when a large portion of the PCD breaks away in a brittle manner. These long, fast growing cracks encountered during use of conventionally sintered PCD, result in short tool life.

DESCRIPTION As used herein, a “superhard material” is a material having a Vickers hardness of at least about 28 GPa. Diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN) material are examples of superhard materials. As used herein, a “superhard construction” means a construction comprising a body of polycrystalline superhard material. In such a construction, a substrate may be attached thereto or alternatively the body of polycrystalline material may be free-standing and unbacked. As used herein, polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is a type of polycrystalline superhard (PCS) material comprising a mass of diamond grains, a substantial portion of which are directly inter-bonded with each other and in which the content of diamond is at least about 80 volume percent of the material. In one embodiment of PCD material, interstices between the diamond grains may be at least partly filled with a binder material comprising a catalyst for diamond. As used herein, “interstices” or “interstitial regions” are regions between the diamond grains of PCD material. In embodiments of PCD material, interstices or interstitial regions may be substantially or partially filled with a material other than diamond, or they may be substantially empty. PCD material may comprise at least a region from which catalyst material has been removed from the interstices, leaving interstitial voids between the diamond grains. A “catalyst material” for a superhard material is capable of promoting the growth or sintering of the superhard material. The term “substrate” as used herein means any substrate over which the superhard material layer is formed. For example, a “substrate” as used herein may be a transition layer formed over another substrate. As used herein, the term “integrally formed” regions or parts are produced contiguous with each other and are not separated by a different kind of material.

In the starting mixture prior to sintering they may be, for example, bimodal, that is, the feed comprises a mixture of a coarse fraction of diamond grains and a fine fraction of diamond grains. In some embodiments, the coarse fraction may have, for example, an average particle/grain size ranging from about 10 to 60 microns. By “average particle or grain size” it is meant that the individual particles/grains have a range of sizes with the mean particle/grain size representing the “average”. The average particle/grain size of the fine fraction is less than the size of the coarse fraction, for example between around 1/10 to 6/10 of the size of the coarse fraction, and may, in some embodiments, range for example between about 0.1 to 20 microns. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of the coarse diamond fraction to the fine diamond fraction ranges from about 50% to about 97% coarse diamond and the weight ratio of the fine diamond fraction may be from about 3% to about 50%. In other embodiments, the weight ratio of the coarse fraction to the fine fraction will range from about 70:30 to about 90:10. In further embodiments, the weight ratio of the coarse fraction to the fine fraction may range for example from about 60:40 to about 80:20. In some embodiments, the particle size distributions of the coarse and fine fractions do not overlap and in some embodiments the different size components of the compact are separated by an order of magnitude between the separate size fractions making up the multimodal distribution.

A version of the method may include making a diamond composite structure by means of a method disclosed, for example, in PCT application publication number WO2009/128034 with the additional step of admixing with the diamond grains, prior to sintering, the grains/particles of non-reactive phase. A powder blend comprising diamond particles, non-reactive phase particles and a metal binder material, such as cobalt may be prepared by combining these particles and blending them together. An effective powder preparation technology may be used to blend the powders, such as wet or dry multi-directional mixing, planetary ball milling and high shear mixing with a homogenizer. In one embodiment, the mean size of the diamond particles may be at least about 50 microns and they may be combined with other particles by mixing the powders or, in some cases, stirring the powders together by hand. In one version of the method, precursor materials suitable for subsequent conversion into binder material may be included in the powder blend, and in one version of the method, metal binder material may be introduced in a form suitable for infiltration into a green body. The powder blend may be deposited in a die or mold and compacted to form a green body, for example by uni-axial compaction or other compaction method, such as cold isostatic pressing (CIP). The green body may be subjected to a sintering process known in the art to form a sintered article. In one version, the method may include loading the capsule comprising a pre-sinter assembly into a press and subjecting the green body to an ultra-high pressure and a temperature at which the superhard material is thermodynamically stable to sinter the superhard grains. After sintering, the polycrystalline super hard constructions may be ground to size and may include, if desired, a 45° chamfer of approximately 0.4 mm height on the body of polycrystalline super hard material so produced.

The precursor structure may comprise carbide particles and diamond or non-diamond carbon material, such as graphite, non-reactive phase particles, and a binder material comprising a metal, such as cobalt. The precursor structure may be a green body formed by compacting a powder blend comprising particles of diamond or non-diamond carbon and particles of carbide material and compacting the powder blend. In some embodiments, both the bodies of, for example, diamond and carbide material plus the non-reactive phase and sintering aid/binder/catalyst are applied as powders and sintered simultaneously in a single UHP/HT process. The mixture of diamond grains, non-reactive phase particles and mass of carbide are placed in an HP/HT reaction cell assembly and subjected to HP/HT processing. The HP/HT processing conditions selected are sufficient to effect intercrystalline bonding between adjacent grains of abrasive particles and, optionally, the joining of sintered particles to the cemented metal carbide support. In one embodiment, the processing conditions generally involve the imposition for about 3 to 120 minutes of a temperature of at least about 1200 degrees C. and an ultra-high pressure of greater than about 5 GPa. In another embodiment, the substrate may be pre-sintered in a separate process before being bonded together in the HP/HT press during sintering of the ultrahard polycrystalline material. In a further embodiment, both the substrate and a body of polycrystalline superhard material are pre-formed. For example, the bimodal feed of ultrahard grains/particles with non-reactive phase particles and optional carbonate binder-catalyst also in powdered form are mixed together, and the mixture is packed into an appropriately shaped canister and is then subjected to extremely high pressure and temperature in a press. Typically, the pressure is at least 5 GPa and the temperature is at least around 1200 degrees C. The preformed body of polycrystalline superhard material is then placed in the appropriate position on the upper surface of the preform carbide substrate (incorporating a binder catalyst), and the assembly is located in a suitably shaped canister. The assembly is then subjected to high temperature and pressure in a press, the order of temperature and pressure being again, at least around 1200 degrees C. and 5 GPa respectively.

The solvent/catalyst material may comprise cobalt that infiltrates from the substrate in to the aggregated mass of diamond grains just prior to and during the sintering step at an ultra-high pressure. However, in embodiments where the content of cobalt or other solvent/catalyst material in the substrate is low, particularly when it is less than about 11 weight percent of the cemented carbide material, then an alternative source may need to be provided in order to ensure good sintering of the aggregated mass to form PCD. Solvent/catalyst for diamond may be introduced into the aggregated mass of diamond grains by various methods, including blending solvent/catalyst material in powder form with the diamond grains, depositing solvent/catalyst material onto surfaces of the diamond grains, or infiltrating solvent/catalyst material into the aggregated mass from a source of the material other than the substrate, either prior to the sintering step or as part of the sintering step. Methods of depositing solvent/catalyst for diamond, such as cobalt, onto surfaces of diamond grains are well known in the art, and include chemical vapour deposition (CVD), physical vapour deposition (PVD), sputter coating, electrochemical methods, electroless coating methods and atomic layer deposition (ALD). It will be appreciated that the advantages and disadvantages of each depend on the nature of the sintering aid material and coating structure to be deposited, and on characteristics of the grain. Similarly, the non-reactive phase particles may be introduced by various means, for example, the diamond grains or particles could be coated with a non-reacting material prior to sintering. In one embodiment, the binder/catalyst such as cobalt may be deposited onto surfaces of the diamond grains by first depositing a pre-cursor material and then converting the precursor material to a material that comprises elemental metallic cobalt.

In this test, the wear flat area was measured as a function of the number of passes of the cutter element boring into the workpiece. The results obtained are illustrated graphically in  FIG.  4 FIG.  4 Further unleached (NZ) samples of PCD embodiments of Example 3 comprising 0.5 vol % zirconia were compared with a conventional unleached PCD sample formed of a unimodal diamond feed having an average diamond grain size of around 3 microns. The results are shown in  FIG.  5 Whilst not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the fracture performance of PCD may be improved through the introduction of the micro-defects and/or stress raisers in a PCD matrix according to some embodiments described herein. The micro-defects and/or stress raisers are believed to promote crack bifurcation or multiple crack fronts in the PCD material in use, resulting in a redistribution of available strain energy or energy release rate (G) amongst the various crack tips. A material that is able to generate multiple cracks under loading would behave tougher than a material with only one major crack since multiple crack fronts ensures that the net energy supplied to the material is divided between several cracks, resulting in a much slower rate of crack growth through the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The end result in application of the PCD material including such micro-defects is that, in use, the number of cracks initiated on the wear scar may be increased as compared to conventional PCD, thus reducing the strain energy available for each individual crack, hence slowing the growth rate, and the generation of shorter cracks. The ideal case is where the wear rate is comparable to the crack growth rate, in which case no cracks will be visible behind the wear scar thereby forming a smooth wear scar appearance with no chips or grains pulled out of the sintered PCD. The addition of a ceramic non-reactive phase may also have the effect of increasing the thermal stability of the PCD through the resultant lower cobalt content in the material of the invention compared to conventional PCD. The size, shape and distribution of these micro-defects may be tailored to the final application of the PCD material. It is believed possible to improve fracture resistance without significantly compromising the overall abrasion resistance of the material, which is desirable for PCD cutting tools. Thus, it is believed that embodiments may provide a means of toughening PCD material without compromising its high abrasion resistance. This may be achieved by engineering micro-defects into the PCD matrix. The concept works by enabling the creation of multiple crack-fronts or defects which help to redistribute or dissipate the available fracture energy. These defects may also promote crack bifurcations, which is another energy dissipation mechanism. The end result is that there is insufficient energy available to each individual crack to enable it to propagate quickly and hence this may significantly slow down the rate of crack growth. The vertical borer test results of these engineered structures show a considerable increase in PCD cutting tool life compared to conventional PCD, and with no degradation in abrasion resistance. Observation of the wear scar development during testing showed the material's ability to generate large wear scars without exhibiting brittle-type micro-fractures (e.g. spelling or chipping), leading to a longer tool life. A 100% improvement in cutter tool life, i.e., double the life of conventional untreated PCD of same average diamond grain size, was noted during testing. Thus, embodiments of a PCD material may be formed having that a combination of high abrasion and fracture performance.

The government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD The present subject matter generally relates to oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloys. For example, the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloys may have improved properties that may be particularly useful in high temperature structural applications. BACKGROUND Oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloys can be used in high temperature structural applications. For example, in an application involving hypersonic aircrafts, leading edge surfaces (e.g., the nose, engine cowls, and the leading edges of wings and stabilizers) may be subjected to very high heat load when operating in the hypersonic speed range (e.g., Mach 5 or greater) as the incident airflow passes through a bow shock and comes to rest at the vehicle surface, which converts the kinetic energy of the gas to internal energy and greatly increasing its temperature. Improvements in materials and manufacturing techniques have enabled hypersonic aircraft to operate at higher speeds and temperatures. For example, materials have been developed to increase the temperatures that a component can withstand while maintaining its structural integrity. In this regard, for example, nickel-based superalloys might be used to 800° C., single-crystal materials might be used to 1200° C., and refractory metals may be required for even higher temperatures. In addition, various cooling technologies have been developed to provide cooling to the leading edges of hypersonic vehicles. However, corresponding advancements in vehicle speed and duration of high-speed flight times have created the need for further improvement in the high temperature durability of the leading edges of high-speed vehicles. Accordingly, improved oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloys are desired in the art for high temperature structural applications, including but not limited to improvements to hypersonic aircraft and propulsion technologies (e.g., improvements in materials of leading edges for hypersonic vehicles).

In one embodiment, a method of forming an oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy is also provided.

The detailed description uses numerical and letter designations to refer to features in the drawings. Like or similar designations in the drawings and description have been used to refer to like or similar parts of the invention. An oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy is generally provided, along with methods of its formation. In particular embodiments, the refractory-based alloy is a refractory-based, high entropy alloy. The oxide dispersions strengthening drives an increase in strength over the base metal solid solution strengthening whereby an initial rare earth oxide is added to a refractory metal matrix and is at least partially dissolved during a mechanical alloying process (e.g., a milling process). In particular embodiments, the mixture of the initial rare earth oxide and the refractory metal matrix is milled until mostly all of the initial rare earth oxide is dissolved therein (e.g., greater than 75% by weight, such as greater than 85% by weight) or until substantially all of the initial rare earth oxide is dissolved therein (e.g., greater than 99% by weight). Thereafter, the milled product may be subjected to a hot consolidation into an oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy and/or an oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy component. During the hot consolidation, a new rare earth refractory oxide precipitates within the metal matrix. The new rare earth refractory oxide is chemically different from the starting rare earth oxide and includes those elements from the starting oxide plus at least one additional refractory element from the refractory metal matrix. In particular, the rare earth refractory oxides have a pyrochlore structure, such as having a chemical formula: Ln 2 2 7  This dispersion of these highly stable precipitated rare earth refractory oxides provides the mechanism for improved strength of the resulting alloy. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the rare earth, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Thus, the presence of the rare earth refractory oxide results in both grain boundary strengthening (Hall-Petch strengthening) as well as direct dispersion strengthening. The alloying strategy for the formation of the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloys may provide a high temperature stable way to increase the strength of the alloy while preserving the required ductility. For example, the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy may be utilized as a hypersonic vehicle leading edge. By utilizing a metal leading edge, a cost reduction over the currently used composites could be achieved, along with an increase in the geometric stability. The refractory-based alloy includes two or more refractory elements (e.g., two or more of niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, hafnium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, or iridium). In particular embodiments, hafnium is included in the refractory-based alloy. Additionally or alternatively, tantalum is included in the refractory-based alloy. The refractory-based alloy may include a single phase or multiple phases. In one particular embodiment, the refractory-based alloy may form a single phase, such as a high entropy alloy (HEA) having a single phase crystal structure that is face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), or orthorhombic. In the formation of the refractory-based alloy, the refractory elements may be provided as individual refractory element powders formed from substantially pure refractory elements (e.g., greater than 99% purity by weight, such as greater than 99.9% purity by weight). That is, each refractory element may be provided as its own refractory element powder. In such an embodiment, the relative amounts of each refractory element may be more easily controlled in the resulting refractory-based alloy. However, in other embodiments, the refractory elements may be provided as an alloy powder. The relative amounts of refractory elements in the refractory-based alloy may vary depending on the application of the resulting component. However, the refractory-based alloy has 50 atomic % or greater in most embodiments so as to ensure the desired high temperature properties. The refractory-based alloy may have greater than 50 atomic % of the mixture of refractory elements (e.g., 50 atomic % to 99.9 atomic %), such as 75 atomic % of refractory elements or greater (e.g., 75 atomic % to 99 atomic %). In particular embodiments, the amount of refractory elements is 90 atomic % or greater to ensure the desired properties in the refractory-based alloy. For example, the refractory-based alloy is formed from 90 atomic % of refractory elements or greater (e.g., 90 atomic % to 99.9 atomic %), such as 95 atomic % of refractory elements or greater (e.g., 95 atomic % to 99 atomic %).

That is, the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy may consist essentially of two or more refractory elements, the rare earth element(s), and oxygen. In these embodiments, the characteristics of the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy may be fully realized. In other embodiments, non-refractory metal elements may be added to the refractory-based alloy, either intentionally or as an accounted for contaminate that may be introduced during processing. For example, non-refractory metal elements may include iron, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, or mixtures thereof. When present, the non-refractory metal elements may be included in an amount of 25 atomic % or less (e.g., in an amount of 10 atomic % or less, such as in an amount of 0.1 atomic % to 5 atomic %). For example, such non-refractory metal elements may be introduced during processing via the milling process due to the use of steel components therein, particularly iron. Additionally or alternatively, non-metal alloying elements may be included in the refractory-based alloy. For example, non-metal alloying elements may include carbon, nitrogen, boron, or mixtures thereof. When present, the non-metal alloying elements may be included in an amount of 5 atomic % or less (e.g., in an amount of 2 atomic % or less, such as 0.1 atomic % to 2 atomic %). As stated, a rare earth refractory oxide is present in the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy. The rare earth refractory oxide is initially provided as a rare earth oxide in a powder form (i.e., a rare earth oxide powder).

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the inclusion of the rare earth refractory oxide in the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy serves to strengthen the refractory-based alloy, even at relatively low amounts (e.g., 1 volume %, or even 0.1 volume %). However, including too much of the rare earth refractory oxide in the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy (e.g., greater than 5 volume %) may begin to change other properties of the oxide dispersion strengthened refractory-based alloy., Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

Notably, high speed vehicles, such as a hypersonic aircraft, typically experience extremely high temperatures and thermal gradients during high speed or hypersonic operation. The temperature gradients that are caused by the high heat flux are often a more severe problem than the temperature itself. For example, the thermal conductivity of the structural material, in combination with the heat flux, sets the temperature gradient within the material, and at high heat loads this gradient leads to mechanical stresses that cause plastic deformation or fracture of the material. The heat load to the structural material should be reduced to maintain the structural integrity of the components. As explained above, the leading edges of such high speed vehicles often experience the highest thermal loading.

Points in the hysterisis loop of particular interest to this invention are within the second quadrant, or ‘demagnetizing curve’, since most apparatuses using permanent magnets operate under the influence of a demagnetizing field and are given in  FIG.  1 The basis for the manufacture of permanent magnets is the existence of magnetic alloys with interesting properties, such as (a) a crystalline structure with a symmetry lower than cubic, e.g. tetragonal, (b) high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (>1*107 J/m3) and (c) high Curie point (the temperature where magnetization becomes zero in a magnetic alloy) which must be greater than or equal to >50% of the predicted maximum working temperature of the permanent magnet. Since the magnetic alloy has high magnetocrystalline anisotropy, another very interesting property is the coercive field Hc defined as the value of the magnetic field that the magnetization is reversed as shown in  FIG.  1 Permanent magnets (permanent ferromagnetism materials) based on the above magnetic compounds have found huge applications in energy generation and conversion, micro-large electrical devices, health and the environment, with a market of more than $20B for 2020.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,264 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textapplications for magnets, such as headphones in speakers, electric motors, generators, counters, and multiform scientific devices. Research in the sector has usually been directed towards the development of permanent magnets with materials that have constantly better properties, especially in recent years, where the reduction in size of devices based on permanent magnets has become the main prerequisite for expanding their applications, such as for computer equipment, mobile phones, headphones and many other devices. Today, there are three large families of permanent magnets produced by sintering and powder metallurgy, by alloys of rare earth metals and transition elements, as described above. The first category is the samarium-cobalt type (Samarium-Cobalt) with stoichiometry (1:5 and 2:17): Most popular is an alloy containing samarium and cobalt with a chemical formula of SmCo5 (1:5)  FIG.  2 The second family of permanent magnets is type Nd2Fe14B: Research efforts by M. Sagawa in 1984 resulted in the discovery of new magnetic alloys containing neodymium that is more abundant in ores containing rare earth elements than samarium, iron that is far cheaper than cobalt and boron in various proportions (see J. Appl. Phys. Vol 55, pages 2083-2087 (1984)). The chemical formula for the new magnetic materials is R2Fe14B (where R is a light rare earth, e.g. neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr) or cerium (Ce) (see A L Robinson, Science, Vol. 223, pages 920-922 (1984). Further guidance on the production of rare earth-iron-boron magnets is disclosed by M. Sagawa, S. Fujimura, and Y. Matsuura in European Patent Applications No. 83 106 573.5 and 83 107 351.5, which were filed on 5 Jul. 1983 and 26 Jul. 1983, respectively. The energy product for neodymium-iron-boron magnets is of the order of 52 MGOe or approximately 420 KJ/m3, which makes these magnets the strongest to date. Due to the low Curie point of the magnetic phase Nd2Fe14B, which is approximately 310° C., the use of these magnets is limited to temperatures up to 130-150° C. Addition of Heavy Rare Earth (HRE) like Dysprosium (Dy) or Terbium (Tb) improves both the energy product and the operating temperature up to 180-200° C. The third category of magnets is type RFe12-xTx: This category was discovered at the end of the 1980s by Buschow (IEEE, Trans. Magn. MAG-24 (1988), 1611) and by Ohashi ((IEEE). Trans. Magn. MAG-23 (1987) 3101), the main characteristic being the lowest percentage of Light Rare Earth (LRE) elements (LRE, e.g. Nd, Pr, Sm) at approximately 7.8%, a Curie temperature at approximately 300° C., high magnetization and relatively high magnetic anisotropy. Although the phase has been known since the end of the 1980s, it has only recently been possible to manufacture permanent magnets with interesting properties, as can be seen from the patent application US2017/0178772 A1, 22 Jun. 2017 with a beneficiary of Toyota.

Mater. 95(2015) 70). Since nitrogen escapes from an alloy at temperatures above approximately 500° C., new techniques are required for the sintering of magnetic powders below 500° C., or new direct casting techniques for permanent magnets. Magnets of this category, although theoretically they have a higher energy product than the previous magnets, are expected to cover the intermediate category with an energy product of 100-250 KJ/m3 due to a lower magnetocrystalline anisotropy. All three categories reported, in addition to their respective costs, energy product and maximum temperature that can be used, have poor mechanical properties, and due to the way they are made from metal powders of appropriate magnetic alloys and by sintering, they are fragile and require great care and attention in their use. In addition, there are: High Entropy Alloys (HEAs): A significant interest has been shown in recent years in exploring new alloys using the concept of high entropy alloy design (HEA). High entropy alloys (HEAs) have been defined since 2004 (Yeh, Advance Engineering, Vol 6, Issue 5, 299-303, 2004) as alloys having at least four main elements in equimolar concentration, which each has an individual rate between 5% and 35% depending on the number of elements used and are shown in  FIG.  3 The HEA alloy design approach has broadened the scope of composition design and new types of HEAs and high entropy materials have been developed, such as high entropy hyperalloys, high density entropy alloys, large metal long entropy glasses, high entropy carbides, high entropy nitrides, high entropy oxides high entropy composite materials. High entropy alloys (HEAs) currently have a high research interest in material science and engineering. Unlike conventional alloys, which contain one and usually two elements of base, HEAs include multiple key elements in equimolar concentration, with the possible number of HEA compositions expanding significantly more than conventional alloys. Most importantly, these HEAs can be constructed and processed using similar procedures as conventional materials. Conventional material characterization techniques for HEA may also be used. Combinations of compositions in the field of HEAs and treatment pathways can potentially lead to a wide range of novel micro-structures and properties. Many preliminary studies have demonstrated their potential to replace conventional materials for industrial applications. The main characteristics of the HEAs are: (i) The high formation entropy of HEA solids has a dominant effect on the Gibbs energy formation of an alloy phase, thus stabilizing solid solutions in relation to the bimetallic phases normally formed, (ii) The HEAs lattice structure is distorted, due to the mismatch of atomic size between allotment elements. This has a number of different effects on the physical and, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,265 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmechanical properties of HEAs, (iii) HEAs have smaller atomic diffusion constants because individual atoms diffusion is more difficult through solid solutions with high concentrations of many elements, mainly due to variations in the lattice structure, (iv) The complexity of HEA formulations causes a so-called ‘cocktail effect’ where interactions between elements cause unusual behavior. In the area of alloy design, we know from previous experience that adding more alloy elements usually leads to the formation of bimetallic compounds, which have poor mechanical properties. Due to the interesting properties, for example, the high entropy phenomenon can reduce the number of phases of ingredients in an alloy and facilitate the design of the preferred micro structure. The limited diffusion effect may reduce the phase transformation rate and stabilize different microstructures at high temperatures. Significant aid may be provided by lattice distortions. And, the cocktail effect allows designing materials with custom properties by selecting the right alloy components. With appropriate alloy design and heat treatment, excellent mechanical properties such as durability, hardness, resistance to wear and corrosion are achieved. Meanwhile, the HEAs have also attracted attention, showing interesting physical properties such as magnetic properties, electrical resistance and superconductivity. New soft magnetic materials are needed in transformers, motors, electromagnets, etc., but the poor mechanical properties of existing materials always limit their performance mainly due to the precipitation of fragile binary compounds. Recently, some high entropy alloys based on FeCoNi—X have been prepared with attractive soft magnetic properties. However, an optimal balance of mechanical and magnetic properties has not yet been found. In assessing these claims on the basis of existing experimental data in literature, as well as the classical metallurgical understanding, it is concluded that the use of high entropy alloys (HEAs) as building blocks for the casting of new phases is one of the most promising and exciting opportunities. HEAs therefore represent one of the most exploratory and promising research areas in materials science at the moment. Problems Resolved with this Invention This invention solves four key problems that coexist in the magnetic phases and the magnets that are made from them. The first problem is economic and concerns the volatility of the price of the components needed for the manufacture of permanent magnets. The price of rare earth elements is controlled by more than 90% from China, the price of cobalt has tripled over the last three years and is expected to increase further due to increased demand for applications for lithium ion batteries, and in addition more than 50% is supplied by the Democratic Republic of Congo. Also, the price of Nd—Pr, which is a component of the best magnets at present, is now tending to increase because of the high, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,265 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textdemand of magnets for electric cars, for wind power and for a variety of other applications. Depending on the category of magnetic phases used in the manufacture of the three groups of permanent magnets, it is possible to save up to 30-40% on the cost of rare earth elements if replaced with the appropriate HEAs based on rare earth elements (RE-HEAs) and up to 50-60% on cobalt if replaced with the corresponding HEAs based on transitional elements (TM-HEAs) with high magnetization. For alloys of the type (RE-HEAs)-(TM-HEAs), the savings that can be made on total alloy costs can reach 50% compared to those currently used. The second problem concerns the scarcity of some rare earth elements, e.g. Dy and Tb, and therefore the possibility of replacing them with a mixture of rare earth elements that are now abundant, e.g. La or Ce, to enable the manufacture of new high entropy alloys with comparable properties to those currently used, namely samarium, neodymium praseodymium. The third problem is that of replacing cobalt which has a magnetic moment of about 1.6 T (Tesla) with corresponding high entropy alloys based on transition metal elements such as cobalt, iron, nickel, manganese and other additives with approximately the same magnetic moment. It is worth mentioning a fourth problem concerning the mechanical properties of permanent magnets and their fragility due to the way in which they are produced. Methods to Resolve these Problems In order to solve the objects outlined above, the present invention provides in a first aspect high entropy alloys of rare earth elements (RE-HEAS) including at least four and up to twelve elements selected form rare earth elements R 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1  12  This first basic approach to solving the above problems is with the use for the first time of high entropy alloys based on rare earth elements with individual numbers from 57 to 71 (except Pm 61) including Yttrium numbered 39 and zirconium numbered 40, due to their chemical affinity for rare earth elements (RE-HEAs). The present RE-HEAs allow to replace especially costly or not abundantly available rare earth metals like samarium, neodymium and/or praseodymium at least partly in their current applications. In some instances it is possible to replace at least half of the amounts of such commonly used high-cost rare earth metals by more abundantly available elements, like La and Ce and thus to considerably reduce the costs involved with providing permanent magnets the demand for which is ever increasing. Preferred examples, but not exhaustive, of inventive RE-HEAs include LaCePrNd, YLaCePrNd, YCePrNdDy, YLaCePrNdGd or LaCePrNdGdHo and optionally additional elements as defined above. However, also other combinations of rare earth elements including Zr and Y can advantageously replace current high-cost or not readily available rare earth materials.

Optionally, also boron (5), aluminum (13), gallium (31) and indium (49) can be included as one of the at least 3 and up to 12 elements. These alloys will be hereinafter referred to as TM-HEAs. Some especially preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention include TM-HEAs with the compositions consisting of or comprising FeCoNi, FeCoNiMn, FeCoNiCu, FeCoNiMnAl or FeCoNiMnCuAl. A further aspect of the present invention is the use of the RE-HEAs and/or TM-HEAs as mentioned above and throughout this specification as building blocks in magnetic high entropy composite alloys for the manufacture of magnetic devices and permanent magnets. As apparent from the foregoing and the following disclosure provided herein, in some aspects all or certain rare earth metals contained in magnetic alloys can be replaced by the RE-HEAs of the present invention and/or all or part of other elements contained in magnetic alloys can be replaced by the TM-HEAs of the present invention. Furthermore, it is also possible to combine both RE-HEAs and TM-HEAs of the present invention as a new high entropy magnetic alloy, optionally including additional materials as defined below.

It is noteworthy that casting (RE-HEAs) without any impediment leads to phases mainly with a hexagonal structure in most cases. Also noteworthy is the fact that casting (TM-HEAs), without any annealing leads to phases with cubic symmetry either FCC or BCC characteristic of high entropy alloys. The most important achievement of this invention is that while the normal magnetic phases used to date for the manufacture of magnets require after casting time-consuming and complex thermal treatment, using high-entropy alloys, it is usually and preferably not necessary to anneal magnetic phases after casting. Due to the exceptional anti-corrosive properties of high entropy alloys (RE-HEAs) and (TM-HEAs), they remain unoxidized for a long time compared to the components of rare earth elements that are rapidly oxidized with air exposure. Also due to exceptional mechanical properties of (RE-HEAs) and (TTM-HEAs) and that slow diffusion leads to a different micro structure, potentially desirable for the development of a large coercive field, this invention covers the possibility of casting rather than sintering magnets. The main advantage of this invention is also to achieve large savings in the cost of raw materials for the manufacture of magnets.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,266 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textFIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present subject matter relates to a niobium carbide-based cemented carbide and method of manufacturing the same and in particular, although not exclusively, to a cemented carbide having a specific microstructure and desired mechanical properties for use in metal forming applications, such as wire drawing and can tooling, as well as metal cutting applications. BACKGROUND Cemented carbides are hard materials that include a hard phase, which is typically hexagonal WC based, along with a ductile metallic binder, which is typically Co-based. Such carbides are commonly referred to as WC-Co based or WC-Co cemented carbides. WC-Co based cemented carbides are widely used hard materials for a broad range of applications such as metal cutting and metal forming due to their excellent hardness, toughness and strength, which yields a favorable Transverse Rupture Strength (TRS) value. To improve the mechanical properties and refine the WC grain size, transition metal carbides may be added in small quantities. However, recently, cobalt and tungsten oxides have been identified as having mutagenic, carcinogenic and reproductive toxicity. These oxides may be present as secondary products during WC-Co cemented carbide production. Accordingly, work has been done to identify alternative materials that may be used as a substitute for WC-Co cemented carbides. Cermets, for example, have been explored as a substitute for WC-Co cemented carbides. In high demanding applications, such as the metal cutting industry, cermets are defined as a composite material typically designed TiC— or Ti(C,N)-based composites with an fcc hard phase and a Co, Ni or Co/Ni-based binder phase. Like cemented carbides, cermets may also include transition metal carbides, usually in higher quantities compared to WC-Co cemented carbides. However, cermets' sintering cycle is more complicated than that of cemented carbides with respect to the various temperature dwells as well as to the sintering atmosphere. Usually cermets need higher sintering temperatures because of the more stable character of cermet hard phases. Furthermore, if nitrogen is in the starting formulation, the outgassing of nitrogen (at higher temperature than the CO outgassing temperature) can give rise to nitrogen porosity. Thus, cermets usually present a sintering cycle that is more complicated and difficult to control than that of cemented carbides. Niobium carbide is generally known for its use as a secondary carbide phase in hardmetals. Its addition usually serves either as grain refiner or as secondary hard phase, sometimes known as gamma phase, helping to enhance wear resistance, limit grain growth and improve hot hardness. Compared to WC and Ti(C,N), NbC has a higher melting point, which yields high values for hot hardness. NbC has substantially low density of around 7.79 g/cm 3 3 Like tungsten, niobium may also be used as a hard phase material in cemented carbides or cermets.

It is commonly accepted that the compositional factors related to the formation of such core-rim structure in Ti(CN)-based cermets during sintering are a combination of the presence and amounts of: Ti, W, C and N. Typical WC-based cemented carbides do not present a core-rim structure. In one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a NbC-based cemented carbide comprising: a binder phase comprising Ni; a hard phase comprising NbC compositionally as the majority component of the hard phase; the hard phase comprising a core-rim structure; wherein the core of said core-rim structure comprises NbC; and the rim of said core-rim structure comprises mixed carbides of any of Nb, Mo and Ta. Reference within the specification to a ‘core-rim’ structure encompass a structure in which the grains of the hard phase (predominantly NbC) are coated, covered, surrounded by or otherwise encapsulated by a further phase that may be regarded a shell, coating or layering to represent a further phase or ‘interphase’. Optionally, the further phase comprises at least or predominantly mixed carbides of anyone or a combination of Mo, Ta, Nb. Moreover, reference within this specification to a ‘core-rim’ or a ‘core-rim structure’ is to be understood as encompassing a phase having a 3-dimensional configuration (i.e. an encapsulating phase to provide a core-shell structure). Core-rim structure references are understood to constitute one single hard phase comprising different compositions dependent on being part of the core or the rim. However, the person skill in the art would also appreciate that reference to the rim of a core-rim structure could be understood as a hard interphase between the core and the binder phase. In particular, the inventors have identified that the abovementioned microstructure of the NbC-based cemented carbide provides an enhanced TRS (compared to other systems known in the art)without compromising the desired and advantageous hardness-toughness values.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,270 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Specific implementations of the present subject matter will now be described with reference to the various examples and accompanying drawings in which: FIG.  1 FIG.  2 FIG.  3 FIG.  4 FIG.  5 FIG.  6 FIG.  7 FIG.  8 FIG.  9 FIG.  10 FIG.  11 FIG.  12 DETAILED DESCRIPTION The inventors have identified an NbC-based cemented carbide material having improved TRS and thermal conductivity for alike hardness-toughness levels as some WC-based cemented carbides. The desired physical and mechanical characteristics are achieved, at least in part, by the selection of the metallic binder. Nickel presents good wettability towards the carbide ensuring a good cohesion of the material, which in turn facilitates sintering process and good mechanical properties. However, the relatively high solubility of NbC in nickel promotes certain NbC grain growth during sintering. In order to limit such grain growth, molybdenum may be added either as elemental and/or carbide form (i.e. Mo, MoC and/or Mo 2 The inventors have identified that such desired physical and mechanical properties may be achieved via a NbC-based cemented carbide having a microstructure presenting a core-rim structure, for which transverse rupture strength is enhanced. Optionally, the Ni content in the cemented carbide is at least 3% or at least 5%, by weight. The Ni may be present 3 to 25 wt %, 3 to 20 wt % or 3 to 15 wt % or in a range 5 to 25 wt %, 5 to 20 wt % or 5 to 15 wt %. Such a configuration provides a contribution to the good toughness values whilst maintaining hardness to an appropriate level, as well as high resistance to corrosion. Optionally, the binder phase of the cemented carbide consists of Ni. In particular, the binder phase comprises exclusively or almost exclusively Ni. However, other components of the cemented carbide may be present as minor wt % components within the binder phase. Such minor components may be elemental or compound forms of remaining/other constituents of the cemented carbide such as Nb, Mo, Ta and optionally W and/or Co. Optionally, the NbC content in the hard phase of the cemented carbide is at least 65 wt %, at least 70 wt %, at least 75 wt %, at least 80 wt %. Optionally, the NbC content in the cemented carbide is in a wt % range 65 to 85, 65 to 83 or 65 to 80. Such configurations provide a contribution to the desired hardness and high hot hardness values, galling and adhesion resistance. Optionally, NbC may be the majority wt % component within the hard phase of the cemented carbide. Reference to the majority wt % component encompasses a mass/weight amount of NbC relative to a mass/weight of any other component present within the hard phase. Optionally, NbC may be the majority wt % component within the cemented carbide based on mass/weight content as part of the cemented carbide relative to any other component present within the cemented carbide.

Optionally, the TaC content in the cemented carbide is in a range 0.3 to 10, 0.5 to 9, 0.5 to 8, 1 to 7.5, 1 to 7, 1.5 to 7 or 1.5 to 6.5. Such a configuration provides a contribution to the enhanced TRS values as well as thermal conductivity whilst maintaining the desired mechanical properties including hardness and toughness. The addition of tantalum promotes the formation of a core-rim structure. Such core-rim structure constitutes an enhancement of the mechanical properties, in particular the TRS. The rim may act as an interphase between the core and the binder phase, making cracks undergo more deflections, with paths mostly going through the carbide grain/binder interphase, that minimizes crack propagation and in turn enhances the TRS. Optionally, the cemented carbide is devoid of WC. In particular, the hard phase may comprise exclusively or consist of carbides of any combination of Nb, Mo and Ta. Optionally, WC may be included as a minority wt % component, the relative amount of which is less than a wt % of each of NbC, Ni and/or Mo 2 Optionally, the WC content in the cemented carbide may be at least 1 wt % but less than 15 wt % or in a range 1 to 15 wt %, 1 to 10 wt % or 1 to 5 wt %. Optionally, WC is included as a minority wt % component of the hard phase and/or the cemented carbide. Such configurations are determined due to inevitable impurities present in the production of the present NbC-based cemented carbide, using conventional techniques and equipment that is also used for WC-based cemented carbides. Such configurations also provide a contribution to the good hardness as well as the thermal conductivity. Additionally, such configurations may contribute, according to certain embodiments, to an increasing effect in the enhancement of TRS achieved by the addition of tantalum and/or tantalum carbide. Above 15 wt %, an additional WC phase may start precipitating. Such precipitates would negate the beneficial effect that the addition of TaC and the core-rim structure provides to the cemented carbide by decreasing the TRS values. Optionally, the cemented carbide is devoid of Co. Preferably, the cemented carbide comprises exclusively Ni as the binder phase. Optionally, and in some embodiments, Co may be present at impurity level (i.e., less than 5 wt %, 3 wt %, 2 wt %, 1 wt %, 0.5 wt %, 0.05 wt % or 0.01 wt %). Optionally, up to a 2 wt % of the Ni content may be substituted by Co for magnetic purposes only. For certain applications, such as can tooling, some equipment may include magnetic sensors for defect detection. Although one of the objectives of the present disclosure is to provide a cemented carbide free of cobalt, the inventors acknowledge the potential need, under certain circumstances, to provide a NbC-based cemented carbide capable of magnetic detection. Optionally, up to a 2 wt % of the Ni content in the cemented carbide is substituted by Co. Optionally,, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

In particular, the invention relates to low carbon aluminium steel alloys and pipes made from such alloys. They may be used in plant such as ethylene cracker furnaces that need to be able to withstand elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Frequently alloy materials for use at high temperatures, for example, alloy tubes used in ethylene pyrolysis cracker furnaces and to some extent steam methane reforming, suffer from insufficient oxidation and carburisation resistance. The industry continues to look for improved materials and other technologies to enable more efficient ethylene production under increasingly severe pyrolysis/cracking conditions (higher temperatures, shorter residence times, and lower partial pressures of product), leading to increased ethylene yields. Current alloys have specific issues related to their corrosion resistance which causes failure at increasingly high design process temperatures. This is the case currently for both castable alloy tubes and wrought alloy tubes. It is necessary to heat the tubes to very high temperatures (above 900° C.) to allow the steam cracking to take place continuously. This places stringent design requirements on the reactor and on the pipes used in its construction. A particular problem concerns oxidation and/or corrosion of the pipes as well as problems caused by coking of the pipes during use. Pipes for steam cracker furnaces can be prepared by a centrifugal casting process. Centrifugal casting is a well-established process that is used to cast thin-walled cylinders, pipes and other axially symmetric objects. One benefit of this process is that it allows precise control of the metallurgy and crystal structure of the alloy product. It is generally used for casting iron, steel, stainless steels and alloys of aluminium, copper and nickel. The centrifugal casting process employs a permanent mould which is rotated about its axis at high speeds of typically 300 to 3000 rpm as the molten metal is poured. The molten metal is centrifugally thrown towards the inside mould wall where it is able to solidify after cooling. The resulting cast cylinder i.e. tube, has a fine grain and the surface roughness of the outer surface of the cylinder is relatively low. JP64-031931 describes the production of a curved tube made of heat-resistant alloy. The tube is prepared by centrifugal casting and the alloy of JP64-031931 is made from high strength and heat-resistant cast steel containing 15 to 30% chromium, 20 to 40% nickel as well as the optional inclusion of smaller quantities of manganese and molybdenum. Small quantities of niobium and titanium are also added to the alloy. The cast tube is then subjected to the further step of an aging treatment at a temperature of from 700 to 1100° C. to deposit secondary carbide within the grain structure.

WO2012/121389 discloses an alloy intended for use in nuclear applications such as in heat exchanges in pressurised water reactors. The material is said to have excellent thin workability and corrosion resistance. This material is based on a nickel-chromium-iron alloy and contains small amounts of manganese, titanium, and optionally aluminium as alloying elements. WO2000/22068 discloses anti-coking coatings for refractory alloys used in the oil industry. The coatings are obtained by a method which involves submitting the refractory alloys surface to the action of oxygen and/or nitrogen gas plasma at low frequency and depositing on the treated surface coating based on silicon oxide, nitride or Oxy nitride by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition at low frequency. US 2002192494 discloses a method for protecting low-carbon steel and stainless steel from coking and corrosion at elevated temperatures in corrosive environments such as during ethylene production by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. The coating is an alloy of chromium, aluminium and silicon together with three other components one of which is selected from nickel, cobalt, iron or a mixture of these elements, the second of which is selected from yttrium, hafnium, zirconium, lanthanum, scandium or a combination of those elements, and the third is selected from tantalum, titanium, platinum, palladium, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, boron or a combination of those elements. The blended powder composition of this alloys applied to the surface and heat treated to bond the coating to the surface. US 2001001399 discloses austenitic nickel-chromium steel alloys based on steel which are particularly suitable for use as heat resistance and high strength materials for parts, such as pipes, in petrochemical cracking furnaces which are intended for the production of ethylene or synthesis gas. The alloy is a low carbon steel containing from 0.3 to 1.0% carbon In addition to all of the usual technical issues associated with preparing a steel pipe for use in chemical plant, there are two particular problems which need to be addressed when fabricating pipes for this type of application. These issues arise because of the harsh working environment that the steel tubes will be exposed to and the fact that any ‘downtime’ in plant operation is very costly in terms of lost production. The pipes need to be resistant to oxidation and/or corrosion during extended periods of use. The pipes also need to be capable of being in service for extended periods of time without coking or fouling. De-coking of reactor tubes is traditionally performed by passing air and steam through the pipes to burn the coke.

The present invention aims to provide pipes which are resistant to oxidation. In addition the invention aims for the surfaces of these pipes to be resistant to coke formation with the intention of reducing the frequency of de-coking operations. It is an aim of the invention that when the alloy is made into pipes the surface of these have a superior resistance to coke formation compared with conventional pipes. Similarly, it is an aim of the invention that once formed into pipes and employed in a chemical reactor or similar environment that the surface of the pipes are stable and resistant to chemical attack or oxidation or corrosion etc. In addition, it is an aim of the invention that the pipes should also to have the appropriate mechanical properties in terms of creep resistance and ductility etc. as existing pipes so that they are suitable for use in high-temperature chemical reactors. It is also an aim of the present invention to prepare a pipe which can be produced in a process which is convenient to run, so that the manufacturing process is relatively straight forward. It is also an aim to provide a process which is applicable to the large scale production of steel alloy pipes. The invention aims to provide a more economic production method and/or which is also more economic when the whole of life use and maintenance interruptions are considered. It is also an aim of the present invention to provide a steel alloy which is economical to manufacture and which avoids or reduces the need for expensive alloying components. It is also an aim to have pipes which can be prepared without the need for further subsequent processing steps. The invention satisfies some or all of the above aims.

2023-07-05 15:08:37,303 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textmechanical properties are required of components in chemical engineering applications. The inventors of surprisingly found that the combination of elements used in the alloys of the present invention also contributes to the high-temperature strength of the steel tube. The individual elemental components in the alloy perform the roles discussed below. Carbon Carbon is required in an amount of 0.15 to 0.35 wt. % in the alloys of the invention. The amount is carefully controlled because carbon has several different functions. For example, carbon is usually an important component of steel for providing tensile strength and resistance to creep rupture. This is because carbon is an essential component in the formation of carbides which normally provide steel with its strength due to the precipitation of the primary and secondary carbides. At the same time, the interplay between the amount of aluminium which is added and the amount of carbon must be closely controlled. Aluminium is generally incompatible with carbon as aluminium rejects carbon in the sense of decreasing its solubility in the austenitic matrix. This has the effect of the carbon migrating to the grain boundaries during solidification with the consequence that the alloy precipitates an excessive quantity of primary chromium carbide, forming a thick network that makes it become brittle. Accordingly, it is necessary to have sufficient carbon in the alloy to ensure sufficient strength in the resulting alloy and this is the reason for the requirement to have 0.15 wt % or more carbon in the alloy. At the same time it is important to ensure that the upper limit of the amount of carbon is not too high so that it adversely interacts with the added aluminium. For this reason, the upper limit of carbon is 0.35 wt %. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of carbon is from 0.20 to 0.35%, and in a more preferred embodiment the amount of carbon is from 0.25 to 0.30 wt %. Aluminium Aluminium is another very important component of the alloys of the invention. Aluminium is present in an amount of from 2.5 to 5.0 wt %. Aluminium alloys are generally difficult to cast and therefore can be hard and difficult work. The steels of the present invention are relatively easy to work despite the presence of aluminium. Aluminium is necessary for the formation of the alumina protective layer at the surface. At the same time aluminium and carbon compete for solubility and this can be a problem. Furthermore, as mentioned above, aluminium also decreases the solubility of carbon but reciprocally the carbon decreases the solubility of the aluminium in the matrix leading to brittleness. Not only because of the precipitation of thick chromium carbide in the grain boundary during solidification, but also because of the possibility of precipitating in addition thick nickel-aluminide intermetallic. Indeed, the aluminium been rejected like the carbon during solidification too by the austenitic matrix. This involves the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,303 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textundesirable nickel-aluminide precipitation, known for its embrittlement properties, during solidification. It is therefore important to ensure that the upper limit of aluminium does not exceed 5 wt % so that the alloy does not become brittle forming uncontrolled excess nickel aluminide intermetallic at the inter-dentric space and grain boundaries. At the same time, a minimum amount of aluminium of 2.5 wt % is required in order to ensure that a substantially continuous coating of alumina on the surface of the alloy can be formed in use. The aluminium is therefore added to the alloy to allow the formation of a thin protective continuous dense homogenous and adherent alumina (aluminium oxide) layer on the surface of the alloy during service. This aluminium oxide layer is oxidation resistant (slow growth of the oxide layer during service prevents further reaction or oxidation of the alloy). The aluminium oxide is a surface stable barrier stopping the diffusion of carbon in the alloy. It serves to facilitate anti-coking (no catalytic reaction involving formation of graphite/coke during cracking), protecting the alloy, and allows its surface to be case neutral when exposed to the gas to be cracked. The higher the aluminium content, the higher the reservoir/stock of aluminium which is important in case the aluminium oxide layer needs to be re-formed. Conditions under which this might be an issue include aluminum oxide spallation due to over-decoking, or variation in the service conditions, or an uncontrolled event in the cracking furnace. The alumina also provides carburisation resistance as described above and hence it is important to ensure that there is sufficient aluminium in the alloy to provide an effective layer. This is the reason for the lower limit of aluminium which is specified. The minimum of 2.5 wt % is important to ensure the formation of the layer at an appropriate rate during service. In the case of the alloys of the present invention, the aluminium content can exceed the usual levels that are normally included in aluminium steels specifically because of the deliberately low level of carbon that is added to the alloys of the invention. It is therefore possible for the amount of aluminium of reach levels much greater than 3.5 wt. % because of the relatively low content of carbon with amounts of aluminium up to 5.0 wt % being achievable without damaging the properties of the alloy. Above this level there is a risk of the alloy becoming brittle such that for example it can break during manipulation or during following steps of manufacture like pipe straightening after casting. The aluminium content is preferably in the range from 3.0 wt % to 5.0 wt %, and more preferably is in the range from 3.2 wt % to 4.6 wt %, such as in the range 3.5 wt % to 4.5 wt %. It is important to note that the maximum and minimum aluminium content is considered relative to the carbon content. This is also relevant to the increase of thermal expansion of the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,303 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textalloy at high temperature. The relative proportions of carbon and aluminium, calculated in terms of their wt % in the alloy, ranges from about 1:33.3 to 1:7.1. Preferably, the relative amounts lie in the range of from about 1:17 to 1:22. Chromium Chromium is present in an amount of from 25 wt % to 35 wt %. The chromium forms a primary carbide network during solidification (as described in the case of carbon) which give primary strength to the alloy, and also forms secondary carbides during service with good creep resistance properties. In the situation in which the aluminium has been fully depleted after long service of the alloy, or following dramatic decoking of the furnace, the chromium will be able to form an oxide layer which will be able to delay the carburisation of the alloy. The chromium content of the matrix is able to delay carbonisation/carburisation of the alloy by trapping the carbon when it is in the process of diffusing thereby forming chromium carbides. Chromium is not anti-coking but provides a well-documented and effective corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance effect in addition to acting as a carbide-former. Carbide formation ensures creep strengthening precipitations in the alloy. The lower limit of 25 wt % of chromium is required in order to ensure sufficient oxidation resistance and the upper limit of 35 wt % is determined by the fact that above this level it is difficult to obtain a stable austenite phase. In addition, too high a level of chromium renders the steel unworkable. In some embodiments, the chromium is present in the range of from 26 wt % to 31 wt %, more particularly in the range of from 28 wt % to 31 wt %, such as in the range 28 wt % to 30 wt %. In certain cases, the amount of chromium is in the range from 29 wt % to 30 wt %. In some alternative embodiments, the chromium is present in the range of from 30 wt % to 33 wt %, and more preferably in the range of from 31 wt % to 32 wt %. The chromium content is determined in balance with the nickel content for the alloy so that the ultimate alloy possesses a stable austenitic base matrix at elevated temperature. It is important that there is a stable austenitic matrix at every expected service temperature to which the alloy is likely to be exposed. It is therefore important to consider the amount of chromium to be used in the context of the amount of nickel that is also present in the alloy. The relatively high quantity of chromium is intended to provide its availability to form chromium oxide on the surface and to allow chromium to trap carbon in the form of chromium carbide in case of carburisation not contained by the thin alumina oxide. Nickel Nickel is present in an amount of from 40 wt % to 45 wt %. The nickel provides the stable austenitic matrix base of the alloy. Nickel is an element which is essential in order to obtain a stable austenite structure and improves the stability of austenite and suppresses the generation of the sigma phase. Nickel is, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textthe austenitic stabiliser element, allowing the alloy to be generally strong at above 800 C. Therefore it forms a stable matrix with the iron which allows the possible precipitation of the carbides/nitrides. The lower limit of the nickel content is chosen simply for the reason that this is a sufficient amount for improving the stability of austenite with respect to the lower limits of the other elements. Nickel is also very important for cracking furnace applications as it give better carburisation resistance to the alloy, because of its slow carbon diffusion kinetics. In this respect, the kinetics of nickel in terms of carburisation are much slower than in the case of iron. On the other hand, nickel can in some circumstances be deleterious because it promotes the formation of catalytic coke when present in the surface of the alloy, and more precisely at the interface alloy/cracking gas. Thus, the upper limit of nickel is required in order to contribute to the carburisation resistance of the alloy but at the same time should not be exceeded because of its known property to promote catalytic coking if it appears on the surface of the alloy. It is therefore important to ensure that not too much nickel is present in the alloy. In addition, nickel is an expensive material and consequently avoiding to hire nickel content also has an economic advantage. The lower limit of nickel is governed by the need to provide an adequate austenitic matrix. In some embodiments, the nickel is present in an amount of from 42 wt % to 45 wt %, and more preferably in an amount of from 42 wt % to 44 wt %. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the nickel is present in an amount of from 42.5 wt % to 43.5 wt %. In some alternative embodiments of the invention, it is possible to replace part of the nickel content by cobalt. Cobalt is able to perform the same function as nickel in the alloys of the invention. In such embodiments, the total amount of cobalt and nickel is from 40 wt % to 45 wt %. Up to 75 wt % of the nickel can be replaced by cobalt, and in principle any amount from 1 wt % to 75 wt % of the nickel can be replaced by cobalt; however, in practice it is more usual for between 5 wt % and 15 wt % of the nickel to be replaced by cobalt on account of the higher cost of cobalt. The quantity of nickel (and cobalt, when present) that is included in the alloy of the present invention is carefully controlled relative to the amount of chromium which is present in order to ensure that the alloy is indeed a stable austenitic matrix at whatever service temperature is employed. Niobium Niobium is present in an amount of from 0.50 to 1.50 wt %. The function of the niobium is to form thin primary carbides during solidification, these primary carbides have the particularity in this specific alloy to re-dissolve at high temperature (therefore during service) and as a consequence to facilitate the precipitation of secondary carbides and ensure their dispersion. This, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textcontributes to the creep resistance of the alloy. The primary niobium carbides therefore act a reservoir of carbon, which can then be released at the service temperature to create more creep efficient carbides. This role is essential, as the Carbon is not in the usual excess that would be typical in a high-temperature alloy having a carbon content above 0.40 wt. %. In the alloys of the present invention, the release of carbon by the niobium compensates for this and therefore provides carbon when it is required. In addition, during solidification the niobium carbides mainly forms at the interdendritic space or grain boundary thereby participating predominantly in the primary carbides network. The amount of niobium employed is chosen on the grounds of its efficiency at disrupting the primary chromium carbide network. In some embodiments, the niobium is present in an amount of from 0.80 wt % to 1.10 wt %, and preferably from 0.80 wt % to 0.90 wt % or from 0.90 wt % to 1.10 wt %. In other embodiments, the niobium is present in an amount of from 1.10 wt. % to 1.30 wt. %. In some alternative embodiments of the invention, it is possible to substitute the niobium with vanadium. Vanadium is a carbide former from the same periodic group as niobium and can be employed in the same amounts as described above for niobium. In addition, a mixture of the two can be employed subject to satisfying the ranges mentioned above for niobium for the mixture. Titanium, Zirconium and Hafnium Titanium and/or zirconium may be present independently of one another in a total amount of 0.01 wt % to 0.25 wt %, and preferably in an amount of from 0.04 wt % to 0.15 wt %. In other words, titanium can be present within the range stated, with no zirconium being present; or zirconium can be present within the range stated, with no titanium being present; or both titanium and zirconium can be present and in this case each may be present in any amount within the range stated, subject to not exceeding the total limit. Both elements function in a similar manner by forming carbides. It is generally preferred to have titanium present. In some embodiments, the amount of the element or elements (usually but not necessarily only titanium) is from 0.08 wt % to 0.15 wt %, and more preferably is from 0.08 wt % to 0.13 wt %. In some embodiments, only titanium is present in this amount and there is substantially no zirconium or hafnium present. Titanium and zirconium are stable carbide-forming elements and are used either singly or together to improve the creep properties of the alloy. Either element individually or both elements together do this by precipitating secondary carbides during service. Furthermore, as carbide forming elements they not only form their respective carbides but also are able to form a titanium/zirconium-niobium double carbide precipitates which improves creep strength. In addition, titanium and zirconium have a second function in that they are very active scavengers for, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textoxygen and consequently they help to protect the aluminium present in the melt from oxidation. These elements are therefore oxidised in preference to the aluminium. Titanium/zirconium are added to melt as a deoxidiser. The quantities of one or both elements that is/are used represents a balance between obtaining an improvement in the creep properties of the alloy (which decrease due to the addition of aluminium) and undesirable oxide, carbides, nitrides formation when too much is added. Indeed, the addition of too high an amount of titanium or zirconium can lead to the undesirable formation of oxide, carbide, nitride, hardening too much the alloy. Cost is also an issue since both of these elements are expensive raw materials. In some alternative embodiments of the invention, it is possible to substitute either or both amounts of titanium and zirconium with hafnium. Thus, in certain embodiments of the invention hafnium can be employed in addition to or in place of one or both of titanium and zirconium. In other words, in some embodiments of the invention there may be no titanium or zirconium present in the alloy and hafnium is present instead of these elements. In other embodiments, some or all of the titanium and/or zirconium is replaced by hafnium, with the consequence that all three elements are present. In this circumstance, the minimum amount of all three elements together would be 0.04 wt % and the maximum amount of all three elements together would be 0.15 wt %. Hafnium is effective at increasing the creep resistance properties of the alloy but has the disadvantage of being an expensive raw material. In certain embodiments of the invention, it is preferable that titanium is used in the alloys of the invention without zirconium or hafnium being present. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, both titanium and zirconium can be used without hafnium being present. Tungsten Tungsten is present in an amount of from 0.01 wt % to 0.25 wt %, and is preferably present in an amount of from 0.05 wt % to 0.25 wt %. Tungsten is a large element in terms of its atomic size and it is also a carbide-forming element. Both of these factors contribute to an improvement of creep properties of the alloy when tungsten is added. The amount of tungsten that is added is a balance between improving the creep properties, and limiting the high temperature resulting plastic deformation elongation involved by its presence. There are diminishing returns in this improvement, on the one hand and the expense of adding tungsten, on the other hand. In some embodiments, the amount of tungsten is from 0.05 wt % to 0.15 wt %, and more preferably is from 0.05 wt % to 0.10 wt %. In certain embodiments, the amount of tungsten is preferably from 0.01 wt % to 0.05 wt %. In certain alternative embodiments of the invention, the tungsten can be replaced by tantalum for the same purpose. In this circumstance, there would be no tungsten present in the alloy and the amount of, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input texttungsten would then be replaced by the same amount of tantalum. In these alternative embodiments, the amount of tantalum would therefore be from 0.01 wt % to 0.25 wt %, with similar sub-ranges being preferred for tantalum as described above in relation to tungsten. However, it is preferable that tungsten is used instead of tantalum. In certain embodiments, both tungsten and tantalum could be used in amounts such that the total amount of both elements is from 0.01 wt % to 0.25 wt %. Yttrium The yttrium is present in an amount of from 0.01 wt. % to 0.25 wt. %, and preferably is present in an amount of from 0.01 wt. % to 0.05 wt. %. A particularly preferred amount is from 0.03 wt % to 0.05 wt %. Yttrium performs several roles in the alloys of the invention. Firstly, it serves to protect the addition of the aluminium in the melt, because the melt is formed in air melt rather than under a special protective atmosphere. Yttrium is more reactive with oxygen than aluminium so it acts as a scavenger for oxygen. In addition, yttrium, when present in small quantities modifies the primary carbide network shape making the resulting carbides thinner and more discontinuous, and consequently less brittle. Yttrium also has the benefit of improving the adherence of the surface oxide layer, acting as ‘sink’ for cavities. It is not necessary to have a very large quantity of yttrium (another very expensive element) in the alloy to achieve these beneficial effects and an amount within the stated range is sufficient for this purpose. In some embodiments, the amount of yttrium is from 0.01 wt % to 0.03 wt %. Silicon Silicon is present in an amount up to 0.9 wt %. In some embodiments, silicon is present in an amount up to 0.6 wt %. In certain embodiments, the amount of silicon is from 0.6 wt % to 0.9 wt %. Silicon provides the function of a deoxidiser and is usually an essential component in an austenite stainless steel. Silicon may also contribute to increasing the stability of any surface oxide film. Silicon also provides some fluidity to the melt bath before the addition of the aluminium to the melt. On the other hand, if the content of silicon is too high the workability of the steel is reduced. A high Si content can also cause the formation of a detrimental phase known as the G phase which is composed of nickel, silicon and niobium (Ni16Nb6Si7). Consequently, the amount of silicon must be carefully controlled. In some embodiments, the silicon is present in an amount of from 0.3 wt % to 0.6 wt %, and more preferably from 0.5 wt % to 0.6 wt %. In certain embodiments, the silicon may be absent or only a lower limit of silicon of 0.1 wt % is needed. Manganese Manganese is present in an amount of up to 0.9 wt %. Manganese can improve the workability of the alloy and it is also an effective de-oxidant and contributes to austenite formation in the steel. However, the high coefficient of diffusion of the manganese at high temperature means that it competes with the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textaluminium. Furthermore, the addition of too much manganese can result in a reduction in high-temperature strength and also toughness over an extended period of time. Consequently, the amount of manganese must be limited to 0.9 wt %. In some embodiments, the manganese is present in an amount from 0.4 wt % to 0.8 wt %, and more preferably from 0.4 wt % to 0.6 wt %. In certain embodiments, the manganese is present in an amount of from 0.7 wt % to 0.9 wt %. In certain embodiments, the manganese may be absent or only a lower limit of manganese of 0.1 wt % is needed. Nitrogen Nitrogen is inevitably present in the alloys of the invention. It is present in an amount of up to 0.10 wt. %. Nitrogen may be found in the alloy because the alloy mix is prepared under an air atmosphere so it is often the case that nitrogen can diffuse into the liquid alloy during its production. However, it is not always possible to determine the amount of nitrogen in the alloy because the amount is insignificant and/or unmeasurable and in these cases the effective amount of nitrogen is almost zero. The absence of measurable nitrogen is not a detriment. Equally, in certain cases there is a measurable amount of nitrogen and in these cases the upper limit is 0.10 wt %. Nitrogen forms austenite together with carbon and it contributes to high-temperature strength. Nitrogen allows the dilution, dispersion, and the homogenisation of the carbon. However, careful control of the amount of nitrogen is important because it slows the precipitation of primary chromium carbides when it is added in a suitable quantity. In effect, the nitrogen helps to control the ‘behaviour’ of the carbon so to control its several precipitations. The nitrogen participates in the precipitation of secondary niobium carbides, niobium carbido-nitrides, and niobium nitrides during ageing which are more stable than carbides at high temperature and therefore have better creep properties. However, if the quantity of nitrogen is too large then an excessive amount of nitrides are produced as chromium nitrides and/or aluminium nitrides which reduces the ductility and the toughness of the alloy over an extended period of time and prevent the ‘nitrided’ elements to fulfil their role in the alloy as they should. It is therefore essential to keep the amount of nitrogen present to a maximum of 0.10 wt %. There is however no practical lower limit to the measurable nitrogen in an alloy sample of the invention. Alloys according to the present invention are produced in a conventional furnace and without the need for a special atmosphere. The first stage of preparing the alloy involves working out the relative proportions by weight of the various component minerals (which are the source of the various elements required in the final alloy) in order to achieve the desired amounts of the various elements which are required in the final alloy. The solid minerals are added to the hot furnace. Heating is continued in order to melt all, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'
2023-07-05 15:08:37,304 - WARNING - An error occurred: input textof the mineral components together and ensure a thorough mixing of the minerals in the furnace so that the elements are properly distributed within the matrix. In circumstances in which the addition of a particular essential element in the alloy composition of the invention also results in the addition of another essential element (because the other essential element is perhaps present as an impurity in the addition agent for the first essential element) then the overall composition must be carefully monitored to ensure that all of the essential components remain within the desired parameters. If necessary, this can be compensated for by adjusting the relative proportions of additional materials used for each of the essential components in the alloys of the invention. Sometimes elements are added in the form of preformed alloys, for example ferrotitanium might be used as a source of titanium and consequently the elemental calculations are adapted as necessary so that the required amount of the element (titanium in that particular example) is correctly added. The skilled person will be able to analyse and compensate as necessary for variations in the essential elemental components due to the presence of incidental impurities using known analytical techniques and by varying the amounts of the usual addition agents for each essential component. A number of elements will be present in the alloy as inevitable impurities. Such incidental elements will not have any discernible technical benefit or adverse effect on the alloys of the present invention. In some cases, the presence of such elements, as the nitrogen can be tolerated in relatively large amounts provided that they do not affect the desired properties of the alloy. For example, although not specifically envisaged in the alloys of the present invention, it is conceivable that an element may arise as an incidental impurity as a consequence of its occurrence as an impurity in one of the deliberately added elemental components. This is acceptable provided that the presence of such an element does not have any deleterious effects on the alloy. In certain cases, deliberately added elemental components such as titanium may bring with them other incidental elements. These can be generally tolerated as incidental impurities at low levels. Where analysis reveals that such impurities are unacceptable, an alternative source of the desired elemental component (free of damaging impurities) is used. The minerals and elements of the alloy composition are careful added in an appropriate sequence in order to obtain the desired content for the final composition. It is also important to protect the aluminium when added to the melt and avoid its oxidation because the melting is performed in air. Once melting and mixing has been achieved, any slag is decanted from the furnace in order to remove impurities and clean the bath of liquid alloy in the furnace. A sample of the molten alloy is then removed from the, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

An adjustment to the composition may or may not be required at this stage to accommodate for any elemental mass loss due to volatility. The composition is adjusted by the addition of further minerals as necessary, and optionally re-analysed to ensure that the desired composition has been achieved. After the desired composition has been achieved, the temperature is further raised above the melting temperature to a tapping temperature in order to ensure easy pouring of the melt. At the same time, the mould is prepared for centrifugal casting. The mould is a conventional centrifugal casting mould and this type of mould is well known to the skilled person. The process of preparing the mould involves washing the mould with water/steam to clean it and to remove any old mould wash or coating that might have been used in a previous casting process. The washed mould is then coated with an insulating/release agent which is required to prevent the alloy from sticking to the mould after casting. A typical insulating/release agent is silica or alumina. A disc of ceramic is then added to the centrifugal casting mould in the manner known in the art in order to ensure that the mould is liquid tight and ready for casting. This prevents any alloy leakage during the casting process. The mould temperature is adjusted in preparation for the casting and may be in the range of 200° to 300° C. The mould is then rotated at high speed to obtain usually the range of 80 g to 120 g, with a rotation providing 100 g being typical for a centrifugal casting speed. A ladle is then brought to the furnace and a desired weight of molten alloy is tapped off for the purposes of casting including the relevant additions, such as titanium and yttrium, in order to reach the final desired quantity of aluminium and other reactive elements of the alloy composition. The ladle itself is preheated to a temperature in the region of 800° to 1000° C. in order to minimise cooling of the alloy after pouring. Alloy is then transferred to the hot ladle. At this stage, a further analysis of the alloy may be performed. The molten alloy in the ladle is then transferred to a pouring cup. The nose of the pouring cup has previously been adjusted to ensure that it mates with and properly fits the size of the input tube for the centrifugal casting mould. The level of molten alloy in the pouring cup is maintained in order to maintain adequate flow of alloy into the mould which is in effect fed by gravity. This provides a continuous flow of alloy into the mould until all of the weight of the alloy has been poured into the mould. The mould is rotated at high speed i.e. maintained at the centrifugal casting speed during the process and whilst the alloy is molten. The length of time the casting process takes depends ultimately on the desired thickness of the tube required and the skilled person is able to, Error: 'BASFMeasurementParser' object has no attribute 'chat_api'

The mould is gradually slowed down as the alloy cools from its solidification point. Generally speaking, a “fast” solidification process is one in which the alloy is cast and then cools at a rate of more than about 100° C. per minute and a “slow” solidification process is one in which the alloy is cast and then cools at a rate of about 50° C. or greater per minute. The casting process is usually completed in less than about 10 minutes. The tube is extracted after the mould stops and the process may be repeated again. The steel tubes of the present invention show excellent high-temperature strength and high creep resistance. The tubes also display exceptional corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures over an extended period of time. Consequently, these steels are particularly suited to use in chemical plant under demanding environments such as steam cracking. In addition, it is expected that steel tubes according to the invention may be used in a variety of other applications such as steam reformers and in nuclear applications in heat exchanges and the like, such as those found in pressurised water reactors. The alloys of the invention were tested to demonstrate effective formation of alumina (aluminium oxide) on the surface in the hostile environment of a pack-carburisation test at 1100 C over a period of 200 hrs for an alloy containing 3.86 wt % aluminium.
