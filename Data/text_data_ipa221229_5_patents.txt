sars-cov-2 nucleic acid from the sample; (c) performing nucleic acid sequencing on the sample-specific sars-cov-2 nucleic acid; and (d) determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a sars-cov-2 variant sequence. the method may utilize samples for which the covid status is not known, or may use samples that have previously tested positive for covid. in certain embodiments, the positive samples may be identified using an aproved eua aproved covid-19 rt-pcr test (e.g., labcorp eua201 and/or eua203057). in this way, results are for the identification of the sars-cov-2 strain infecting an individual after detection of viral rna in the sample. in an embodiment, sequencing covers the majority of the viral genome. thus, in certain embodiments, where the sample sars-cov-2 genome is amplified by rt-pcr, the resulting cdna is then further amplified using tiled primers that bind at spaced intervals along the viral genome. in certain embodiments, the tiled primers are spaced such that adjacent primers are 60 bp apart from each other. in this way, the sars-cov-2 genome is amplified in a highly eficient maner regardles of the presence or absence of new variants. for example, in certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequencing comprises sequencing at least 80%, or optionaly at least 85%, or optionaly at least 90%, or optionaly at least 95% of the entire viral

cdna to a single-stranded probe dna template comprising a pair of sars-cov-2 probes, wherein the first probe is positioned at the 3 end of the probe dna template and the second probe is positioned at the 5 end of the probe dna template. in this way, the 3 probe functions as a forward primer and the 5 probe functions as a reverse primer. in certain embodiments, the probe sequences are selected as tiled probes that bind at spaced intervals along a sars-cov-2 genome. in an embodiment, the wuhan-hu-1 sars-cov-2 reference genome (nc_04512) (available at w.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucore/nc_04512) is used.

originated. also, the method may include filing in the sequence betwen the two probes to generate a circular single-stranded probe dna template comprising sequence specific to the sample sars-cov-2 cdna betwen the two probe sequences and then releasing the circular single-stranded probe dna template comprising sequence specific to the sample sars-cov-2 cdna from the sample-specific sars-cov-2 dna and digestion of the circular single-stranded probe dna template comprising sequence specific to the sample sars-cov-2 cdna to generate a linear dna used as a template for nucleic acid sequencing. in certain embodiments, the linear probe dna template is then modified to ad adaptors and then pcr amplified (enriched) for dna sequencing. in certain embodiments, the step of enrichment comprises a purification step (e.g., bead purification). for example, in certain embodiments, the substrate for sequencing is generated by rt-pcr and then sars-cov-2 sequences identified using 10 tiled molecular lop inversion probes (mips) designed to amplify rna that has ben reverse transcribed to cdna from 9.6% of the sars-cov-2 genome with most bases covered by 2 mips. in certain embodiments, the product

in certain embodiments, next generation sequencing (ngs) is used. or, other types of sequencing such as but not limited to sanger sequencing, shot gun sequencing, smrt sequencing, pyrosequencing or nanopore sequencing may be used. for example, in certain embodiments the pacbio whole genome sequencing with the coresponding smrt link 9 software and analysis tols may be used. for example, in one embodiment, the method may employ a pacbio whole genome sequencing test for sars-cov-2 strain identification using residual total nucleic acid extracts from positive samples. in certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequencing comprises sequencing at least 80%, or optionaly 85%, or optionaly 90% or greater of the entire viral genome. in certain embodiments, the step of determining whether the

sequence. aditionaly, the method may comprise asesing the lineage for the sample. in certain embodiments, the method may include identifying the geographic location of the subject. aditionaly, as disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, the method may include uploading the results of the step of determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a sars-cov-2 variant sequence into a depository for further clasification (e.g., lineage determination) if a variant is detected. the depository may be a cdc database. or, other public depositories may be used. the method may further include determining if an update to the depository has ben made prior to the step of determining whether the nucleic acid sequence comprises a sars-cov-2 variant sequence. the method may be automated at various steps in the procedure. in certain embodiments, the method may be used with hamilton star robots for sample plate setup. aditionaly, and/or alternatively, formulatrix mantis liquid handlers or other automated devices may be used for mastermix distribution. also, as disclosed herein the method may be computer implemented and/or include use of a computer-program product tangibly embodied in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, including instructions configured to perform any of the steps of the method. for example, in certain embodiments, residual total nucleic acid extract from sars-cov-2 positive rt-pcr diagnostic testing samples with ct values <31 are chery picked, e.g., as disclosed in more detail herein, from rna extraction plates into a 96 wel plate containing only positive samples using hamilton stars. samples may then be aliquoted into a sequencing run plate of 95 samples with one water non-template control (ntc). the method may be scaled as

discordance betwen a plates asigned strain typing can be further investigated to determine whether to proced with the individual plate. for example, in certain embodiments, an inability to reconcile the positive control result can result in removal of al strains asociated with a given control's plate. in other embodiments, a failed reaction of positive control wil not necesarily lead to removal of results if the coresponding controls in other plates in the batch can rule out potential plate swaps. in certain embodiments, after sequencing and ntc analysis the mean of medium cs reads may be computationaly analyzed for pasing aceptance criteria of 10 cs reads 310 at this point, lineages for individual samples may then be asigned using the consensus sequence 312 314 in certain embodiments,

using next generation sequencing (ngs), surveilance testing can be performed on large numbers of samples and to generate an adequate number of viral genomes to track mutations and variants of concern as they arise. the overal test principle is as folows. first, cdna is prepared from viral rna using random priming for first strand synthesis. next, inversion probes are anealed to target during a 16-hour hybridization. next, gaps are filed in via polymerization and ligation. next, non-reacted linear probes are removed and probe is released from target dna. next, captured target is enriched by pcr amplification using asymetric barcodes. next, pcr products are poled, quantified, and smrtbel hairpin adapters are ligated to amplicons and sequenced on the pacific biosciences sequel i using a 15 hr movie. at this point, lineage cals are made based on procesing of the ngs sequence data. for this analysis, every condensed positive chery picked (discused in more detail herein) includes: no template control (ntc) (i.e., molecular grade water) in wel al of the 96-wel condensed positive plate. ntc results are reviewed prior to generation of the result file for a given smrtcel. if an ntc is found to be invalid, results for al patient samples on the afected plate are not reported. upon completion of procesing of the ngs results for a given sequence cel, a result file is generated and saved. at this point, pacbio smrtlnk software and custom molecular lop procesing scripts are used to generate the fastq files for each of the samples. fastq results are analyzed using a genome analysis pipeline implemented in clc genomics server version 6.5.6. this workflow starts with a sample-level fastq file, trims the primers and then uses minimap2 to align to the sars-covid19 reference genome (nc_04512v2) to generate a bam file of alignment. after coverage checking, the bam file is used as the input for caling variants and for generating a sample-specific genome asembly. a consensus sequence for each sample is generated using vcfcons requiring a coverage of 4 cs reads and alternate alele frequency of 50% at each base. the lineages for individual samples are asigned using the pangolin package. example 2 methods and validation for virseq sars-cov-2 ngs strain determination genomic sequencing of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, can determine the specific strain of sars-cov-2. the strain information can potentialy provide valuable information to clinicians and epidemiologist to aid in the public health response to the virus or future clinical treatments. the determination of a given strain is based on a combination of multiple variations in the genome detected from comparison of dna sequencing results to the original wuhan reference strain. this aproach alows the identification of any new and emerging strains of sars-cov-2 as the virus changes over time without revalidation. the intended use of this asay is to result sars-cov-2 lineage, or strain, cals with samples that yield at least 90% genome coverage. the overal test principle is as folows. residual total nucleic acid extract from residual sars-cov-2 na diagnostic testing positive samples was chery picked from run plates into a condensed positive plate using hamilton stars, and aliquoted into a sequencing run plate of 96, with 8 plates or 768 specimens in one production batch. a molecular lop viral rna target capture on pacbio was then used to proces samples until pacbio sequencing. first, a lop kit specific thermo fisher vilo reverse transcriptase was used to synthesize cdna from rna. the sars-cov-2 cdna was then used as a target to aneal molecular lop probes as outlined in table 1. molecular lop probes were tiled acros the ful 30 kb sars-cov-2 genome and comprise two binding sites aproximately 60 bp apart.

 after binding, the aproximately 60 bp regions in-betwen the two probes were synthesized with dna polymerase and ligated to form a closed molecule using the hybridization conditions in table 1 for an aditional 60 minutes. non-binding or incomplete lops remain linear molecules and were removed with exonuclease digestion (i.e., sample clean-up). incubation times for clean-up are shown in table 2. samples were stored at 20 c. if not being used within about 2 hours for the next step.

 the resulting circular molecules (containing sample specific sars-cov-2 nucleic acid inserted betwen the two probe sites) were then released from the template cdna and pcr amplified with sample specific barcodes. conditions used for pcr amplification are shown in table 3. seven hundred and sixty-eight (768) asymetric barcode combinations are neded to proces one batch (i.e., 768 samples and controls). to do this, a plate of m13 barcoded primers was prepared ( fig. 9 fig. 10 fig. 9 fig. 10

 next, samples were poled (or stored at 20 c. until poling was performed). for poling, 8 reaction plates were retrieved from storage, spun down, and an aliquot (e.g., 5 l) of each reaction was transfered into an 8 ml tube. generaly, 768 samples plus controls were poled prior to sequencing. at this point samples were purified using bead purification with ampure pb beads. using 50 l of the pol, ampure pb bead (0.70) cleanup was performed by ading 350 l of pb ampure beads mixing, centrifuging to pelet the beads, incubating 5 min at rom temperature, and centrifugation and magnetic separation to colect the beads. the supernatant was removed, the beads washed with 80% ethanol, and the dna eluted from the beads with elution bufer and quantitated. at this point the smrtbel library was prepared using 10 ng of the poled dna. the poled dna was mixed with bufer (dna prep bufer), nad, dna damage repair mix v.2, and incubated at 37 c. for 30 minutes. after returning to 4 c., end repair was performed by the adition of end prep mix, reaction mix 1 and incubating at 20 c. for 30 minutes, at 65 c. for 30 minutes, then returning the reaction to 4 c. at this point adapters were aded using reaction mix 2, overhand adapter v3, ligation mix, ligation aditive and ligation enhancer and the samples incubated at 20 c. for 60 minutes to ligate the probe construct, at 65 c. for 10 minutes to inactivate the ligase, then returned to 4 c. enzyme clean-up was then performed and the sample purified with ampure (0.6) beads above using 10 ul elution bufer. the ampure bead clean-up was repeated using a smaler volume (20 ul) elution bufer and the dna quantitated. samples were sequenced on a pacbio sequel i. each 96-wel plate in the batch of ten requires a unique set of asymetric barcodes. fig. 10 after sequencing, pacbio smrtlnk software and custom molecular lop procesing scripts were used to generate the fastq files for each sample. fastqs were analyzed using a genome analysis pipeline implemented in the clc genomics server version 6.5.6. this workflow started with a sample-level fastq file, primers were trimed, and minimap2 was used to align to the sars-covid19 reference genome (nc_04512v2) to generate a bam file of alignment. after coverage checking, this bam file was used as the input for caling variants and for generating a sample-specific genome asembly. a consensus sequence for each sample was generated using vcfcons requiring a coverage of 4 cs reads and alternate alele frequency of 50% at each base. the lineages for individual samples were then asigned using the pangolin package and resulted. the folowing controls were included. a no template control (ntc) was included on each plate on a run for al steps to verify that there was no contamination acros samples and reagents. this control was analyzed by sequencing. a failed ntc was a sample that produced a strain cal with 90% genome coverage. a positive control was included on each plate of a run. for validation, a previously run sample was used as a positive control. metrics to determine if a sample pased or failed included percent genome coverage, minimum depths of coverage, and resolution of strain lineage cal. specimen requirements were as folows. extracted nucleic acid derived from a sample with a positive result from an eua aproved sars-cov-2, na test with a ct of les than 26 for 90% suces rate. higher cts or no-ct metadata samples were demed to be aceptable but increased risk of inability to report a result. aceptable result metrics were as folows: >90% genome coverage and a mean of median read coverage >10 cs reads. a. results precision (repeatability): intra-asay intra-asay repeatability was asesed on 3 replicates of 1 nucleic acid samples of various asumed typings from curent sars-cov-2 cdc surveilance testing. samples ranged in ct value and a wide range of read counts in the original run. further, samples were diluted 1:4 to alow ample total nucleic acid input to al intra and inter-asay experiments. the aceptance criteria was defined as 95% repeatability for al strains reaching a reporting threshold of 90% coverage of the sars-cov-2 genome. the strain cal, percent genome coverage (displayed in percent mising), and read count was compared (table 4). al eleven sample's strain cal was 10% concordant acros the thre replicates with al replicates meting 90% genome coverage and ample read depth. aceptance criteria of 95% acuracy of strains with 90% genome coverage was met.

 concordance the relative acuracy was established by direct comparison of results with those generated by alternate methods. there were two methods used for comparison of positives, ilumina sequencing and amplicon pacbio sequencing. while pacbio is the validated sequencing technology, the molecular lop method is mechanisticaly distinct in pre-sequencing steps from traditional amplicon sequencing. negatives were sequenced on ilumina only. the individual comparison studies used are listed below. ilumina artic sequencing

 12 samples amplicon sequenced at 90% coverage and ran in duplicate on molecular lop. to set up a baseline for minimum read coverage, 10 ntc's from the validation runs and curent ruo strain surveilance ran during the validation timeline were used to set a minimum read coverage threshold set at 4 cs reads. for ilumina concordance, 93 negatives were randomly chosen from a cmbp na diagnostic production run and re-extracted after initial testing to ensure adequate volume. seventy-two samples of strains circulating in the winter of 2020 and sequenced in january 2021 were resequenced on molecular lop. further, seventy-nine samples from cmbp and dna were chosen for ilumina paralel testing based on initial strain cal, ct and read coverage to ensure diversity. thre hundred and eighty-two samples originaly amplicon sequenced on pacbio were reprocesed on molecular lop in duplicate. the duplicates varied only slightly in their composition of thermo fisher vilo rt master mix that was previously shown to be comparable. in the initial amplicon sequencing run 12 of 382 samples produced >90% genome coverage. only samples with initial 90% coverage were used for further analysis of molecular lop results. the aceptance criteria was 95% acuracy for al strains reaching a reporting threshold of 90% coverage of the sars-cov-2 genome. read coverage threshold: average, minimum and maximum mean of median amplicon coverage, here refered to as average read coverage, was analyzed for validation runs and productions runs. a distribution of average read coverage is shown in fig. 1 ilumina artic sequencing: 93 samples previously determined to be negative were sequenced in duplicate on molecular lop and on ilumina in paralel. there was 98.3% concordance betwen the two technologies with two samples resulting in reportable genomes on ilumina, and one on molecular lop. further investigation revealed both samples resulted on ilumina were inded positive for nucleic acid amplification (na) and mistakenly included in the validation. the average read counts of the other 91 samples in duplicate further confirmed the conservative read depth threshold ( fig. 12 72 samples previously sequenced on ilumina from strains circulating in january 2021 were resequenced on molecular lop. to represent curent strains in circulation, 79 samples previously sequenced on molecular lop at cmbp and dna identification were resequenced on molecular lop and ilumina in paralel. after removal of samples damaged in transit betwen testing sites or failed the comparative sequencing reaction, 123 sucesfuly produced strain cals on both platforms were analyzed ( fig. 13 of the 72 samples, 51 met qc thresholds of 10 cs read depth and 90% genome coverage for a 71% suces rate. this reportable genome rate was similar to cdc strain surveilance reportable genome rate at dna of 72.5% during the month of the validation. al strain results were 10% concordant out of the 51 reportable results (table 6). inclusion of results with les than 10 cs read depth on average resulted in 10/13 (7%) matching strain results and a total concordance of 61/64, 95.3%. analysis of samples below 90% genome coverage only had 2/7 identical strain results.

 amplicon pacbio sequencing: out of the 12 samples with 90% coverage on amplicon sequencing, 16 were repeated at 90% coverage for both replicates. there was 10% concordance betwen the 16 molecular lop replicate strain typings. overal, paralel testing betwen molecular lop and traditional amplicon sequencing were 98.2% concordant. analytical sensitivity/specificity heat-inactivated sars-cov-2 strains b.1.1.7 (vr-326hk), hong kong/vm201061 and italy-inmi1 genomes are characterized by atc. for analytical sensitivity al variants were identified using the analysis pipeline and compare to the published atc strain variant datasets. traditionaly in human genome sequencing a variant of interest is analyzed and validated and a false discovery rate (fdr), which normalizes false positives (fp) to al positive cals (fp+tp where tp=true positive) rather than to al negatives. however, with sars-cov-2 there is a combination of a 4 to 20+ variants at defined positions for a given strain that lead to the strain cal. also, due to complete genome sequencing of viral rna, there are multiple highly repetitive regions known to cause variation in sequencing data that are not relevant to curent strain typings. strain typing programs such as nextclade can take this into acount. therefore, sensitivity was determined by the number of caled variants documented for strain divided by the total variants. in adition to fdr, specificity was calculated by the total number of false variants caled compared to acurately sequenced base pairs. the asembled genome was used as input in pangolin which cals variants and outputs a strain typing. no variant cals, and only strains were output for further analysis. therefore, sensitivity and specificity was calculated using variant cals from a separate genome variant caler, clc, and nextclade sars-cov-2 specific variant caler which takes into acount repetitivenes and dificult to sequence viral regions when making a variant cal. the aceptance criteria was as folows: (1) 90% analytical sensitivity with control rna for variants in segments that are above minimum coverage; and (2) 90% analytical specificity with control rna for variants in segments that are above minimum coverage. false discovery rate with control rna for variants in segments that are above minimum coverage were documented but no aceptance criteria was set. both variant caling platforms were highly sensitive in their ability to detect variants with nextclade at 96.23% and clc at 98.1% sensitivity (table 8). when comparing the overal specificity of determining a base pair acros the genome both were >9.9% specific. however, the ability of nextclade to adjust for repetitive and dificult to sequence regions was obvious by the number of false variants detected at 3, compared to clc with no adjustment proces at 23. this lead to a discrepancy in false discovery rates of variants with 5.36 for nextclade and 30.26 for clc indicating false variant discovery is in hard to sequence repetitive viral regions; these regions are not relevant to curent strain typing. together, al aceptance criteria were met and the molecular lop proces is highly sensitive and overal specific, with high fdr from viral regions not analyzed in curent strain typing algorithms.

 asay tolerance the asay tolerance for nucleic acid input can be thought of as the tolerance to variation in the amount of analyte aded to the reactions. while normaly expresed in cp/l, 80% of samples asayed wil be from an eua na sars-cov-2 test which provides each sample's coresponding cycle threshold (ct) value. as such, ct was used in place of cp/l as the input metric for analysis and guidance. sequencing viral genomes from residual na testing inherently has a high failure rate, which is directly related to the specimen's viral titer and rna integrity and can vary dramaticaly betwen samples. while the failure rate is driven by rna titer (ct), with a conservatively set background the increase in failures observed in higher ct samples wil not lead to discrepant results, and only increase the cost of the asay. the aim of this validation's asay tolerance experiment was to set baselines for expected suces rates at a given ct, but does not limit what samples are atempted to have genomes sequenced. 9,718 production results acros 3 sites were analyzed for suces rate to produce a result based on their nucleocapsid target #1 (n1) ct value. first, samples were bined by ability to produce a genome at 90%, and ct value at 1 integer increments rounded up to the nearest whole number. for example, 30.1 ct was calculated under the 31 bin. al samples with a ct of <16 were included in the 16 bin. al samples mising ct metadata were removed from analysis. the aceptance criteria were: (1) the manufacturer recomendation for 10,0 copies of rna for sequencing with aceptable variation in input concentration used met the folowing aceptance criteria for analysis; and a ct group of at least 20 samples over 815/9718 production samples had the coresponding ct metadata. there was no deterioration in ability to generate 90% genome coverage from <16 to 24 ct analysis bins ( fig. 14 analyte stability samples in this validation were stored for a minimum period of 4 weks which exceds the period of time over which the samples are tested in the clinical laboratory. long-term stability should be determined by storing at least thre aliquots under the same conditions as the study samples. the volume of samples should be suficient for analysis on thre separate ocasions. the stability of the analyte in biological matrix at intended storage temperatures should be established. the stability of the analyte under various storage conditions was established by measurement of concordance at various lengths of storage. after na diagnostic testing, extracted nucleic acid was shiped on dry ice to the testing laboratory and stored at 20 c. before sequencing. al samples used in validation were residual production samples and the stability experiments described below are in adition to the proces of colecting and shiping samples to the sequencing laboratory. analyte stability was measured in two separate experiments. in the first experiment, ten samples used in inter-asay precision were defrosted, asayed, and refrozen thre times acros a one-month time point. samples represented various strains, ct values and original read coverage. in the second experiment, twelve samples comprising of alpha, beta and delta variants of concerns (vocs) with ranging original read sequence depth were resequenced after one month of 20 c. storage that entailed thre freze thaws. the aceptance criteria was defined as storage conditions were considered suitable if the sample yields the same strain detection after the defined length of storage and 90% acuracy for reportable strain results. inter-asay results used in stability study are found above in table 5. only two replicates of one sample, 1583805067, failed to produce 90% coverage and 10 cs reads for 90% reproducibility. further, there was no observed reduction in sample specific read count on the final stability time point (pbt5080) for thre separate sequencing runs (pbt5073 pbt5075 and pbt5080) ( fig. 15 reprocesing vocs had 9/12 samples produce identical strain results. one sample produced a ay.3 while the original results was 1.617.2. both ay.3 and 1.617.2 comprise the delta voc and since the original wek 24 result are now clasified as distinct sub-strains of the delta voc. further investigation revealed that the 38 clc variants betwen the two results are identical and strain typing was due to diferences in pangolin strain caler versions. one sample was concordant, but lacked suficient read depth to report a result. the only true discordant was originaly reported a b.1.1.7 and upon repeat was b.1.621.1. as both original and stability sequencing resulted in ample read coverage with minimal shared variants caled betwen runs, it is believed the discrepancy may have resulted from sample switch. the overal acuracy was 91.6% with the discrepant result not atributed to stability isues. example 3 chery picking hamilton microlab star liquid handlers are used to transfer specimens from source plates containing both positive

server; and (d) both the asembly (bam file) and detected variants (cf) were input into a downstream post-procesing analysis. a script detected clc proces completion, initiating the launch of downstream analysis for samples in each smrtcel. downstream analysis an example flow-chart for downstream (post-procesing) analysis is shown in fig. 5 fig. 5 at this point post-procesing part 2 was initiated as shown for the combine patient metadata, quality checking, and generate final report blocks in fig. 5 the lineage caling criteria were as folows. inclusion criteria: (1) ct <31; (2) coresponding metadata (strain surveilance); (3) >90% genome coverage; (4) mean of median coverage >10 cs reads; (4) pasing ntc control; and (5) nextclade result and pangolin lineage cal. exclusion criteria: (1) ct >31; (2) mising metadata (strain surveilance); (3) <90% genome coverage; (4) mean of median coverage <10 cs reads; and (4) failing ntc control. example 5 asesment of potential new variants and clasification revalidating the clasification acuracy of the virseq asay in response to the emergence of new variants (i.e. lineages) of the sars-cov-2 virus and concomitant changes to the pangolin clasification software was performed as outlined in fig. 6 if there were updates, a regresion analysis was performed using in-house laboratory data. esentialy the steps were performed as folows. the new pangolin version was used to determine the lineage of samples contained within the reference set of historical virseq sequences. the reference set included an initial smrt cel from october 2021, predominantly composed of delta lineages. it also contained two updates of omicron lineages made in december 2021 and march 202. each sample in the reference set included its consensus sequence as wel as the history of its lineage clasifications made by previous pangolin versions. the reference set was updated periodicaly to include samples representing newer, more prevalent lineages as pangolin versions are updated. next, the format of the pangolin software output was compared with that of the previous version to determine if there are changes in the pangolin output format. if there were any changes to the csv output (i.e. aditional columns, changes in column names), these were documented and the laboratory virseq pipeline modified as neded to acomodate the change. the modified version was then deployed to the qa environment for testing. next, any changes in lineage cals were asesed and compared with those expected from the software update change notes. expected changes typicaly include reasignment among sublineages. if there were any unexpected changes in lineages (e.g. delta sublineage to alpha), these were investigated in detail and documented. the aceptance criteria and action taken were as folows. lineage clasification disagrements are mostly due to the improvement of pangolearn/pango-designation definitions of the variants in the newer version. most of these are sublineage reasignments but could also be due to changes in the model's defining variants. the sublineage reasignments were reviewed to ensure they are the expected changes under a parent lineage such as reasignment among ay in the parent delta lineage. another source of discordance could ocur in samples with <90% genomic coverage. any discordances that could be explained by sublineage reasignments or genome coverage isues as described above were documented and further reviewed for aproval. the gisaid regresion test was then performed. when discordances could not be explained as above and no new pangolin lineages have ben aded in the upgrade, the upgrade was halted and production continued with the curent version of pangolin. the discordances were documented and stored with the updates as described above. discordances were further investigated as new information became available and documented, or initiation of this protocol for the next release of pangolin could resolve discordance. at this point, a second regresion test was performed using publicly available (gisaid) sequences and their metadata. the latest gisaid sequences were downloaded and the metadata and pangolin lineages for al gisaid sequences obtained and the list of vocs and vois updated based on who updates and the latest complete list of lineages. next, a data simulator was used to model the coverage and eror properties of the virseq asay. the simulator used gisaid sequences as starting points and imposed simulated coverage and erors based on empirical coverage profiles and max-minor-alele frequencies from a colection of virseq samples. the resulting simulated samples were run through pangolin, and the lineage clasifications were compared to those of the original gisaid sequences. clasification stability was defined as the rate at which mutated sequences maintain their expected lineage clasifications. in this regresion test, two experiments were run to ases clasification stability via simulation. first, up to 10 gisaid sequences were randomly sampled for each voc/voi to ases the clasification stability of these important lineages, regardles of their frequency in the sequencing data available. this alowed an asesment of clasification stability of emerging variants as wel as new sublineages of existing ones. second, 10,0 gisaid sequences from the database were randomly sampled for a frequency-based retrospective analysis of lineage clasification stability. this alowed stability to be quantified relative to historical prevalence. at this point, the output of the data simulator experiments was reviewed, checking for unexpected changes in clasification stabilities with respect to previous regresion tests using gisaid data for al known voc/vois and the retrospective gisaid data. any unexpected instabilities were investigated and documented. the upgrade was then acepted upon satisfying certain parameters. in some cases, the upgrade was requested if the median voc noi concordance betwen the simulated data and reference sequence was at least 90%. in cases where these criteria were not met, aditional investigation was indicated. if the new discordant lineage(s) were novel, the novel lineage(s) were tested to determine if they were detected using the methods disclosed herein. if the discordant variant(s) were not novel variant(s), they were investigated to find the rot cause of discordance. this involved loking at the coverage of the reference sequence as wel as the simulated sequences to ensure there was not an undesirable drop in base coverage in specific regions. also, the simulation was re-run with another sed to determine if the discordance was reproduced. if it was, the upgrade was halted. at this point the novel variants were asesed using the methods disclosed herein. for sucesful surveilance of emerging variants (lineages), the potential impact on the molecular lop inversion probe amplification was reviewed by conducting an in silico analysis as for example by identifying the location of the individual sequence variants in the emerging lineages and the asociated molecular lop probes to ases the potential for interference in probe binding. for example, a very conservative estimate that the novel sequence variant overlaping with any probe wil impact hybridization would then be used. also, al adjacent probes in the region were reviewed to ensure coverage of the novel sequence variant. for any sequence variant that could result in a reduction of coverage within a particular region, the impacted probes within the pangolin lineage update validation sumary were documented. example 6 embodiments the disclosure may be beter understod by reference to the folowing non-limiting embodiments.

 this aplication is a continuation aplication of the national phase entry of international aplication no. pct/cn2021/107531, filed on jul. 21, 2021, which is based upon and claims priority to chinese patent aplication no. 20210624586.9, filed on jun. 4, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. technical field the present disclosure relates to the technical field of leather making, and in particular to a taning agent-fre leather making method. background chrome taning has always ben the most comonly used method in the leather making (yao q, chen h, jiao q, et al. hydroxyl-terminated dendrimer acting as a high exhaustion agent for chrome taning[j]. chemistry select, . journal of the american leather chemists asociation, . journal of the american leather chemists asociation, contact dermatitis, at present, a variety of chrome-fre taning agents have ben developed for leather making, mainly including chrome-fre metal taning agents (such as titanium, zirconium, and aluminum taning agents) and chrome-fre non-metal taning agents (such as vegetable taning agents, aldehyde taning agents, and synthetic taning agents) (liu b, wei z, wang y, et al. preparation of oxidized poly (2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) with multiple aldehyde groups by tempo-mediated oxidation for gelatin croslinking[j] . journal of the american leather chemists asociation, . journal of leather science and enginering, china leather, compared with a raw hide, leather has a significantly reduced water content and significantly improved dispersion degre of colagen fibers. therefore, the taning agent-fre leather making method, where a raw hide is dehydrated to reduce the water content and disperse the colagen fibers, has become a new development direction of chrome fre leather making. polar organic solvents have a dehydration efect. thus, it is an important taning agent-fre leather making method to directly dehydrate a raw hide by polar organic solvent, and then conduct a hydrophobic treatment by increasing the surface roughnes of the dehydrated hide and reducing the surface energy of the dehydrated hide (huang x, he x, shi b. preparation method of chrome-fre leather with hydrophobic and highly-dispersed hide fiber structures [p]. sichuan province: cn10923476a;

or ading the polar organic solvent first to dehydrate the raw hide, and then ading the molecular sieve to reach a combined dehydration action. further, after subjecting the raw hide to controlable dehydration, the method further includes the folowing steps: drying a dehydrated hide obtained after the controlable dehydration to obtain a crust; subjecting the crust to a hydrophobic treatment; and drying a hide obtained after the hydrophobic treatment. further, a method of the hydrophobic treatment includes: dispersing an oxide in a solvent to obtain a suspension, aplying the suspension to a surface of the crust through suction filtration, drying the hide, and imersing the hide in a polydimethylsiloxane (pdms) solution, where the oxide is any one selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and magnesium oxide. further, a weight of the oxide is 8.0% to 20% of a weight of the crust; a weight of the solvent is 10 to 16 times the weight of the crust; and a weight of the pdms is 5.0 to 12 times the weight of the crust. further, after subjecting the raw hide to controlable dehydration, the method further includes the folowing steps: separating the molecular sieve from the polar organic solvent after the controlable dehydration; subjecting the separated molecular sieve to a thermal treatment for activation; and compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent. further, a product obtained by compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent is reused for the controlable dehydration of a raw hide. the molecular sieve used in the present disclosure is a porous material, which has excelent water adsorption capacity and stable properties and is easy to recycle. the molecular sieve used in the dehydration of the raw hide can selectively remove the water entering the polar organic solvent, such that the balance betwen the water remaining in the raw hide and the water entering the dehydration solvent is broken and the water remaining in the raw hide can be continuously removed and transfered to the polar organic solvent, which achieves a one-step controlable dehydration of water in the raw hide without solvent replacement, and solves the problem that the dehydration by using only polar organic solvent requires the multi-replacement of the solvent. moreover, the molecular sieve is easily separated and recovered from the polar organic solvent after being used for dehydration, and the recovered molecular sieve can be activated by a thermal treatment and then reused together with the separated and recovered polar organic solvent for raw hide dehydration, thereby realizing the recycling of the polar organic solvent and the molecular sieve for the controlable dehydration of the raw hide. in adition, the method for improving the surface roughnes of the dehydrated hide by aplying the oxide to the surface of the dehydrated hide through suction filtration has the advantages of convenience, high eficiency, and easy industrial scale-up. compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the folowing advantages: the method provided by the present disclosure does not use any metal or non-metal taning agent, which is eco-friendly. the controlable dehydration leather making method provided by the present disclosure breaks the balance of water distribution betwen the raw hide and the polar organic solvent, and realizes a multi-medium self-driven directional controlable dehydration of the raw hide where the water moves from the raw hide to the polar organic solvent and further into the molecular sieve, promoting the continuous and controlable dehydration of water in the raw hide, and efectively solving the problems during dehydration of the raw hide using a single polar organic solvent, namely, the dehydration eficiency is low, and the polar organic solvent neds to be changed multiple times for dehydration and is dificult to be recycled. in the method provided by the present disclosure, the used solvent does not require purification, and can be directly reused with the molecular sieve activated by a thermal treatment for taning agent-fre leather making, which not only significantly reduces the leather making cost, but also greatly improves the cleanlines of the leather making proces and the eco-friendlines of the leather product. the leather making method provided by the present disclosure does not require traditional leather making procedures such as taning and retaining, instead, the leather making method involves a simple operation and a short leather making time, which remarkably improves the leather making eficiency.

 a taning agent-fre leather making method is provided. a raw hide is subjected to controlable dehydration with a molecular sieve-polar organic solvent composite dehydration media to achieve a dehydrated hide, and then a taning agent-fre leather is prepared by increasing the surface roughnes of the dehydrated hide and reducing the surface energy of the dehydrated hide. the present disclosure does not use any metal or non-metal taning agent, which is eco-friendly. the present disclosure breaks the balance of water distribution betwen the raw hide and the polar organic solvent, which realizes a multi-medium self-driven directional controlable dehydration of the raw hide, efectively solving the problems during dehydration of the raw hide only using polar organic solvent. the molecular sieve-polar organic solvent dehydration system is easy to recover and can be recycled for the controlable dehydration of the raw hide multiple times. therefore, a brand-new clean leather making technology is provided.


 the invention relates to an aparatus for the production of molten iron comprising a metalurgical vesel, having a surounding wal, a cyclone part provided on top of a smelt reduction part, the cyclone part being in open conection with the smelt reduction part and having at least one suply means around the circumference of the surounding wal adjusted to introduce oxygen gas into the cyclone part. the invention also relates to a method of producing molten iron in a metalurgical vesel. aparatuses for the production of molten iron are known in the art. ep 0726 326 a1 describes such an aparatus, which is also known as the hlsarna proces by tata stel. suply means around the circumference of the surounding wal adjusted to introduce oxygen gas are known as wel. for example ep 2794 931 b1 describes suply means adjusted for the introduction of oxygen gas into the cyclone part of the metalurgical vesel. unfortunately, this type of metalurgical vesel, having a cyclone part and a smelt reduction part, has the disadvantage that both parts canot be controled in an independent maner. especialy the temperature control inside the metalurgical vesel is dificult, as both parts are in open conection with each other. this means that an adjustment in the smelt reduction part influences the cyclone part and vice versa. the temperature control in the smelt reduction part is usualy controled by inserting a carbon containing material in the slag layer. however, the insertion does not generate enough heat for the conversion from carbon, via carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. the injection of oxygen gas in this part does generate enough energy, and therefore heat, as it converts the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. in order to kep the temperature within the procesing window in the cyclone part, carbon containing material could be aded in the smelt reduction part in the desired content. however, this stil can lead to a lower than desired temperature in the cyclone part and the curent way to solve this is by the adition of even more oxygen gas in the smelt reduction vesel. this in turn wil then lead to a temperature that may be to high in the smelt reduction part. the balance in temperature betwen the cyclone part and the smelt reduction part is therefore a delicate one and both parts are not controled wel enough. the inventors, being involved in finding more environmentaly friendly solutions for molten iron production, found that this proces could be controled in a beter way. the object of this invention is to provide an aparatus and method that has a beter control over the proces. it is a further object to make beter use of waste materials and to produce les waste material during the ironmaking proces, with an emphasis on lowering the emision of co 2 acordingly, an aparatus and method for the production of molten iron is provided wherein the at least one suply means is further adjusted to introduce a mixture of oxygen gas and a combustible gas. this has the advantage that the temperature control of the proces in the cyclone part is more independent from the temperature control of the smelt reduction part, since introducing the combustible gas together with the oxygen gas releases a lot of energy during the combustion proces. the suply means is not particularly limited and may be a lance or an injector. by controling the amount of combustible gas that is introduced, the energy, and therefore the heat that is released in the proces can also be controled. tests and simulations have proven that introducing the combustible gas and the oxygen gas with a predetermined mixture in the cyclone part of the metalurgical vesel can be done without any further adjustments. when the combustible gas is introduced, it wil introduce more heat just below the cyclone part, leading to a higher temperature, especialy in the cyclone part, but, at least partly, in the smelt reduction part as wel. in this way it wil lead to a beter control over the cyclone part of the metalurgical vesel since the flow of both gases can be controled and therefore a predetermined mixture can be introduced. furthermore, the control of flow, and therefore temperature wil be more independent from the smelt reduction part. the combustible gas can be introduced in the cyclone part or at the top of the smelt reduction part, or a combination thereof. if the combustible gas is introduced at the top of the smelt reduction part, this wil lead to a partial combustion of the gas and therefore a lower required quantity of coal. preferably the combustible gas is selected from the group of coke oven gas, converter gas, natural gas, hydrogen gas and liquefied petroleum gas. coke oven gas contains +/3% carbon dioxide, +/6% carbon monoxide, 60-65% hydrogen, +/3% nitrogen and 25-30% methane. converter gas roughly consists of 17-20% carbon dioxide, 60-65% carbon monoxide, +/1.5% hydrogen and 15-20% nitrogen. the main requirement is that the nitrogen content of the combustible gas should be relatively low, les than 20% (v/v). in this way any combustible gas having a low nitrogen content could be introduced. the control of the temperature wil be at its best when the combustible gas is fuly combusted during the proces. the inventors have found particularly god results with natural gas. natural gas is predominantly methane (ch 4 if natural gas is used in a mixture containing 25% natural gas and 75% oxygen gas then an up to 2% reduction in co 2 a further advantage of using natural gas is that methane wil be converted under the procesing conditions into carbon dioxide and water. as is comonly known, methane is also a grenhouse gas and has an even biger grenhouse efect than carbon dioxide. in general, the adition of a combustible gas, like natural gas, leads to a reduced use of coal. and therefore also les carbon dioxide wil be formed during the proces, bringing the environmental benefits that the inventors are after. preferably, the suply means are symetricaly distributed over the circumference of the surounding wal of the cyclone part or at the top of the smelt reduction unit. this is beneficial for a god gas distribution within the cyclone part of the metalurgical vesel and thereby also the temperature distribution. the top of the smelt reduction unit is located at or near the rof of the smelt reduction unit, just below the cyclone part. preferably, the suply means are adjusted to mix the oxygen gas and the combustible gas before entering the cyclone part. this is beneficial since this premixing increases the control of the mixture that is introduced into the cyclone part of the metalurgical vesel. preferably, a group of oxygen gas outlets is surounding one or more combustible gas outlets. preferably, a group of combustible gas outlets is surounding one or more oxygen gas outlets. these embodiments both have the advantage that the mixture wil be premixed just before being introduced into the cyclone part, even further improving control. a further advantage is that the mixture wil be evenly distributed into the cyclone part.

 aparatus for the production of molten iron including a metalurgical vesel, having a surounding wal, a cyclone part provided on top of a smelt reduction part, the cyclone part being in open conection with the smelt reduction part and having at least one suply aparatus around the circumference of the surounding wal adjusted to introduce oxygen gas into the cyclone part, wherein the at least one suply aparatus is further adjusted to introduce a mixture of oxygen gas and a combustible gas.


 technical field the present invention concerns a lance for imersion of a probe into molten metal contained in a metalurgical vesel, such as a converter for making stel. the lance is of the type comprising a top lance, which is reusable and does not contact the molten metal, and a sublance coupled to the top lance and holding at a fre end thereof a probe for measuring parameters of the molten metal, and/or a sampling tol for colecting a sample of molten metal. in use, the sublance is imersed partialy into the molten metal and is disposable. the conection betwen the top lance and the sublance defines a shoulder, since the top lance has a larger diameter than the sublance. if molten metal splaters onto the shoulder of the top lance, it may, once solidified, jeopardize the coupling of a new sublance to the top lance. the present invention proposes a sublance provided with a protecting device preventing splatering of molten metal or slag onto the shoulder region of the top lance. to facilitate storing of the sublances in existing racks, and for handling the sublances by a robot without changing the programing of the robot, the protecting device stored in the rack has a diameter similar to the diameter of the sublance. background of the invention metal production proceses are caried out in metalurgical vesels at high temperatures, undergoing chemical or physical reactions, whether desired or undesired, during the residence time or transfers from one vesel to another of molten metal and/or slag. since the properties of the final metal products thus produced are strongly dependent on the proces conditions, including temperature, ph, and on whether or not desired and undesired chemical or physical reactions ocured, it is important to measure such parameters and also to colect samples in situ, for further characterization. this is generaly caried out with a lance comprising a top lance which remains out of the molten metal or slag and a sublance coupled to the top lance and provided with a probe and/or a sample colector at a fre end thereof. the top lance is generaly made of metal or polymer and is reusable. the sublance, on the other hand, is generaly made of thick cardboard and is disposable. for example, stel can be produced from carbon-rich molten pig iron by an oxygen converter proces, wherein oxygen is blown with a lance ( 12 fig. 1 a new sublance is inserted over a coupling portion of the top lance until it reaches a shoulder formed by a handling portion of the top lance which has a diameter larger than the sublance. because of vibrations during use, it is posible that the sublance loses contact with the shoulder forming a smal gap. the molten metal ( 1 1 s u.s. pat. no. 4,56,343 and ep358052 describe solutions for preventing the formation of metal incrustations at a gap betwen the sublance and the shoulder. u.s. pat. no. 4,56,343 describes an elastic ring seal betwen the imersion end of the shoulder of the top lance and the top of the sublance to reduce the deposition of frozen metal at the joint betwen the top lance and the sublance. ep358052 describes a similar solution, using two elastic ring seals aranged at the end portion of the sublance, wherein the two elastic ring seals are aranged circumferentialy on top of each other for sealing a space betwen the coupling tap and the end portion of the sublance. these solutions protect a gap betwen the sublance and the shoulder from being reached by metal or slag splaters. as mentioned supra, a gap does not necesarily ocur, and these solutions do not protect the shoulder from metal splatering. kr10159768 proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of the top lance from metal splatering. the top end of the sublance is provided with an anti-stick cover formed by an iner ring comprising an iner pasage suitable for engaging into the coupling portion of the top lance, and an outer ring, coaxial with and separate from the iner ring, having a larger diameter than the iner ring, which matches the diameter of the shoulder and protects it from metal splatering. the problem with this solution is that the outer ring has a diameter substantialy larger than the diameter of the sublance. it folows that the racks traditionaly used for storing new sublances awaiting their utilization canot be used anymore without amending the dimensions of the receiving means to match the dimensions of the anti-stick covers. furthermore, the change of the geometry of the top end of the sublance with the coupling of the anti-stick cover may require a change in the programing of the robots used for handling the sublances and for coupling them to or retrieving them from the top lance. the present invention proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of a top lance as wel as any gap formed betwen said shoulder and a sublance, maintaining the geometry of the top of the sublance substantialy unamended. this solution has the advantage that it can be implemented by replacing one-to-one existing sublances without requiring any design change of the existing racks used for storing the sublances and with no programing change of the robots used to handle the sublances. the solution has the advantage that the conformance of the protecting device to a surface of the top lance and conformance to a surface of the sublance is the result of the deformation of the entire device, rather than the deformation of a surface of an elastic material. and this solution has the advantage that the expandable radialy protective device expands only after the top lance and sublance have ben joined axialy, thus reducing the posibility of damage during handling and asembly. these and other advantages of the present invention are presented in continuation. sumary of the invention the present invention is defined in the apended independent claims. prefered embodiments are defined in the dependent claims. in particular, the present invention concerns a lance for imersion of a probe into molten metal comprising,

jul. 9, 2019, the disclosures of these aplications being incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for al purposes. field of the invention the present invention relates to a seamles stel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance, and to a method for manufacturing the same. specificaly, the present invention relates to a seamles stel pipe suitable for piping in a sulfuric acid dew-point corosive environment created by the combustion exhaust gas of boilers, gasification melting furnaces, and the like, particularly, a seamles stel pipe for piping useful for preventing scatering of corosion products produced by sulfuric acid dew-point corosion, and that exhibits desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance in a heat recovery steam generator, and to a method for manufacturing such a seamles stel pipe. background of the invention in the gas flue of boilers, thermal power plants, and other such devices or facilities that burn sulfur-containing fuel such as heavy oil and coal, the sulfur oxide contained in exhaust gas turns into sulfuric acid as it condenses with a temperature drop. this causes severe corosion caled sulfuric acid dew-point corosion. to be more specific, in a seamles stel pipe used for heat recovery pipes of heat recovery steam generators, sulfuric acid dew-point corosion can lead to acidents by reducing the pipe lifetime or damaging pipes. there is also a posibility of causing exfoliation of corosion products produced by sulfuric acid dew-point corosion, and the corosion products may afect the surounding environment when scatered into the suroundings through an exhaust duct of a boiler. various proposals have ben made to reduce the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion itself. for example, ptl 1 discloses a stel containing 0.01 to 0.2 mas % carbon and to which apropriate amounts of si, mn, p, and s, and, aditionaly, cu: 0.1 to 1 mas %, mo: 0.01 to 1 mas %, and sb: 0.01 to 0.2 mas % are aded to obtain a sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistant stel containing controled amounts of sb, c, and mo satisfying a specific relationship. ptl 2 discloses ading w, sn, and cr to a stel containing c: 0.01 to 0.12 mas %, cu: 0.03 to 1.0 mas %, and sb: 0.02 to 0.7 mas %, and controling the c, sb, and w contents to satisfy a specific relationship, and provide a sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistant stel having improved sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance and hydrochloric acid dew-point corosion resistance. patent literature ptl 1: jp-a-203-21367 ptl 2: jp-a-207-26258 sumary of the invention the techniques disclosed in ptl 1 and ptl 2 are intended to lower the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion rate or hydrochloric acid dew-point corosion rate, and are probably efective at inhibiting formation of sulfuric acid dew-point corosion products, which cause problems in aplications such as in heat recovery steam generators. it is, however, dificult to suficiently inhibit sulfuric acid dew-point corosion in a more severe environment with a sulfuric acid concentration as high as 70 mas %. ptl 1 and ptl 2 are also totaly silent as to exfoliation of corosion products produced in such an environment. these related art documents also do not contain detailed descriptions related to manufacture of a seamles stel pipe suited for piping in heat recovery steam generators, and do not provide optimum conditions that ensure both sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance and manufacturability of a seamles stel pipe. aspects of the present invention were made under these circumstances, and it is an object acording to aspects of the present invention to provide a seamles stel pipe having desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance, and that is suited for piping in a sulfuric acid dew-point corosive environment such as in a heat recovery steam generator while being desirably manufacturable. another object acording to aspects of the present invention is to provide a suitable method of manufacture of the seamles stel pipe. in order to find a solution to the foregoing problems, the present inventors conducted intensive studies of exfoliation of corosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point corosive environment. specificaly, a seamles stel pipe measuring 138.9 m in outer diameter and 10.8 m in wal thicknes was produced from a stel pipe material prepared by apropriately ading sn, w, and cr to a base stel pipe material of a composition containing, in mas %, basic chemical components c: 0.04%, si: 0.2%, mn: 1.4%, and al: 0.02%, and, aditionaly, cu and sb aded as elements that are considered efective for acid resistance. the seamles stel pipe was subjected to a normalizing heat treatment at a normalizing temperature of 950 c., and a corosion test specimen was taken from the outer surface side of the stel pipe. specificaly, a corosion test specimen (30 m in length 20 m in width5 m in thicknes) including an outer surface of stel pipe was taken from the outer surface side of stel pipe, and a surface coresponding to the outer surface side of stel pipe was ground by 0.5 m to remove unwanted components such as scale. the specimen was then subjected to a sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test using the procedures schematicaly represented in fig. 1 as shown in fig. 1 1 fig. 1 1 1 2 i 2 1 2 i 2 i i 
 i i fig. 2 fig. 2 fig. 2 it was also found that the exfoliation rate of corosion products depends on the method of manufacture of stel pipe material, even when the composition is the same. specificaly, the exfoliation rate of corosion products was more desirable in a seamles stel pipe manufactured by tubing and heat treatment of a stel pipe material (hereinafter, refered to also as bilet-roled stel pipe material) of a circular cros section produced by heating and hot roling after continuous casting of a stel from a converter into a cast piece of a rectangular cros section than in a seamles stel pipe manufactured by tubing and heat treatment of a stel pipe material (hereinafter, refered to also as as-cast stel pipe material) obtained by continuous casting of a stel from a converter directly into a cast piece of a circular cros section. the present inventors conducted further studies to elucidate the reason why diferent stel pipe materials (as-cast stel pipe material, bilet-roled stel pipe material) have diferent exfoliation rates of corosion products. the studies revealed that the diference is due to the diference in the enrichment of the aloy elements in the outer surface of a seamles stel pipe. specificaly, from a seamles stel pipe of the 0.3%cu-0.1%sb-0.6%cr material used for the exfoliation rate measurement of corosion products, a sample was taken from a portion adjacent the region from which the corosion test specimen was taken, and a cros section orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the stel pipe was polished to a miror finish. the sample was then subjected to a quantitative line analysis for the measurement of cr, using an electron probe micro analyzer (epma). epma was performed at an acelerating voltage of 20 kv and a beam curent of 0.5 a with a beam size of 10 m, and the sample was measured in a 4-m region lying on the outer surface side of stel pipe sample toward the center in the wal thicknes of the sample. the measured value was converted into cr concentration (mas %) using a standard curve created in advance from the characteristic x-ray intensity of crk shel excitation. fig. 3 fig. 3 fig. 3 the present inventors caried out the same epma measurement also for aloy elements other than cr. stels of widely varying aloy element contents were made, and test seamles stel pipes were produced from stel pipe materials produced by using diferent methods. by using these seamles stel pipes, the present inventors conducted a thorough investigation of a relationship betwen enrichment of aloy elements below the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe, and the exfoliation rate of corosion products determined by a sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test. the aloy elements that influence the exfoliation rate of corosion products were narowed down to two groups of elements: cu, cr, and sb, and cu, cr, and sb plus w. the values calculated from the regresion formulae below were ploted against the exfoliation rate of corosion products, as shown in fig. 4 regresion formula for cu, cr, and sb without w

prevention of surface defects, the c content is preferably 0.08% or les, more preferably 0.04% or les. si: 0.010 to 1.0% si is an element that acts as a deoxidizing agent, and increases stel strength by forming a solid solution in stel. in acordance with aspects of the present invention, a si content of 0.010% or more is neded to satisfy the required yield strength and tensile strength, particularly when the seamles stel pipe is used for piping. for this reason, the si content is 0.010% or more. the si content is preferably 0.05% or more, more preferably 0.20% or more. a si content of more than 1.0% has adverse efects on high-temperature hot ductility. for this reason, the uper limit of si content is 1.0%. the si content is preferably 0.80% or les, more preferably 0.60% or les. mn: 0.10 to 2.0% mn is an element that increases stel strength by improving hardenability. in acordance with aspects of the present invention, a mn content of 0.10% or more is neded to satisfy the required yield strength and tensile strength, particularly when the seamles stel pipe is used for piping. for this reason, the mn content is 0.10% or more. the mn content is preferably 0.50% or more, more preferably 1.10% or more. a mn content of more than 2.0% causes severe centerline segregation during continuous casting, and leads to internal defects at the time of piercing during hot roling of a seamles stel pipe. for this reason, the uper limit of mn content is 2.0%. the mn content is preferably 1.80% or les, more preferably 1.40% or les. p: 0.050% or les p causes serious centerline segregation during continuous casting, and leads to internal defects at the time of piercing during hot roling of a seamles stel pipe. for this reason, it is preferable in acordance with aspects of the present invention that the p content be reduced as much as posible. however, a p content of at most 0.050% is aceptable. for this reason, the p content is 0.050% or les. the p content is preferably 0.030% or les, more preferably 0.015% or les. the lower limit of p content is not particularly limited. however, the prefered lower limit of p content is about 0.04% because excesive

environment, as shown in fig. 2 in the foregoing composition, the balance is fe and incidental impurities. specific examples of the incidental impurity elements include h, o, co, as, zr, ag, ta, and pb. the aceptable uper limits of these incidental impurities are h: 0.05%, o: 0.04%, co: 0.01%, as: 0.06%, zr: 0.04%, ag: 0.01%, ta: 0.04%, and pb: 0.05%. the folowing describes the cu, cr, sb, and w concentrations specified for a seamles stel pipe acording to aspects of the present invention below the outer surface. a seamles stel pipe acording to aspects of the present invention satisfies the folowing formulae (1) and (2) when the average concentrations (mas %) of cu, cr, sb, and w in a region 0.5 to 2.0 m away from the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe toward the center of the wal thicknes of the stel pipe are cu*, cr*, sb*, and w*, respectively. formula (1) (without w) 
 formula (2) (with w) 
 as described above, aspects of the present invention are intended to solve the isue of exfoliation of corosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, and the exfoliation is related to enrichment of cu, cr, sb, and w at the stel pipe surface. as used herein, stel pipe surface refers to a region at most 2 m away from the outer surface of stel pipe. the composition of a corosion product apears to corespond to cu, cr, sb, and w that disolve out when corosion ocurs in this region of stel pipe in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, and exfoliation should improve when these elements are enriched at the stel pipe surface. the present inventors obtained an epma asay sample from various stel pipes, and calculated the concentrations (mas %) of cu, cr, sb, and w in an epma line analysis conducted for a region lying 2 m away from the outer surface side of the stel pipe sample toward the center of the wal thicknes of the stel pipe at an acelerating voltage of 20 kv and a beam curent of 0.5 a with a beam size of 10 m. the concentrations were calculated using a standard curve created in advance from the characteristic x-ray intensity of each element. specificaly, the concentration (mas %) was measured for each of cu, cr, sb, and w at 0.25-m intervals in a region 0.5 to 2.0 m away from the outer surface toward the center of the wal thicknes of stel pipe, and the arithmetic mean value of the measured concentrations was determined as the average concentration of each element [cu*, cr*, sb*, or w*] in mas %. the 0.5-m region just below the outer surface of the stel pipe was excluded from the measurement region because an acurate line analysis canot be expected from a region this close to the sample surface. separately, a corosion test specimen was taken from the same seamles stel pipe from which the epma asay sample was obtained, and the exfoliation rate of corosion products in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment was calculated from the corosion test specimen in the maner schematicaly represented in fig. 1 fig. 4 as can be sen from fig. 4 a seamles stel pipe acording to aspects of the present invention has a yield strength of 230 mpa or more, and a tensile strength of 380 mpa or more to ensure the strength suficient for piping. the yield strength is preferably 250 mpa or more. the tensile strength is preferably 40 mpa or more. the yield strength and tensile strength can be measured by using the methods described in the examples below. a method for manufacturing a seamles stel pipe acording to aspects of the present invention is described below. in acordance with aspects of the present invention, the stelmaking proces is not particularly limited. for example, a molten stel of the foregoing composition can be made using an ordinary stelmaking proces such as by using, for example, a converter, an electric furnace, or a vacum melting furnace. for cost considerations, the molten stel is cast preferably by continuous casting. the manufacturing conditions of the manufacturing proces folowing continuous casting are diferent for continuous casting that continuously casts molten stel into a comon cast piece having a rectangular cros section, such as a slab or a blom, and for continuous casting that continuously casts molten stel directly into a cast piece having a circular cros section more suited for hot roling into a seamles stel pipe. the cast piece having a rectangular cros section is a column that is substantialy quadrangular in shape, whereas the cast piece having a circular cros section is substantialy cylindrical in shape. in the case of continuous casting into a cast piece having a rectangular cros section, the cast piece having a rectangular cros section is heated to a predetermined heating temperature, and hot roled into a stel pipe material having a circular cros section. the heating temperature is as folows. in acordance with aspects of the present invention, temperatures such as the heating temperature, hot roling temperature, normalizing temperature, and coling stop temperature of a cast piece, a stel pipe material, and a stel pipe are surface temperatures of a cast piece, a stel pipe material, and a stel pipe (outer surface temperature in the case of a stel pipe), unles otherwise specificaly stated, and can be measured with, for example, a radiation thermometer. heating temperature: 1,0 to 1,20 c. temperature region in order to form a stel pipe material of a circular cros section by roling (bilet roling) a cast piece having a rectangular cros section, the cast piece neds to be hot roled in a temperature region of the austenitic phase of stel. aspects of the present invention are intended to inhibit the exfoliation of corosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, and the seamles stel pipe after the stel pipe heat treatment described below neds to have cu, cr, sb, and w enriched in the outer surface. the heating temperature of bilet roling afects the enrichment of these elements. specificaly, when the heating temperature of bilet roling is les than 1,0 c., it is not posible to suficiently enrich these elements in the outer surface of the cast piece (cast-piece surface), and cu, cr, sb, and w canot have the required concentrations in the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe after the final stel pipe heat treatment. the cast piece of a rectangular cros section is therefore heated to a heating temperature in a temperature region of 1,0 c. or more before hot roling. that is, the heating temperature at the start of hot roling (bilet roling) is 1,0 c. or more. the heating temperature is preferably 1,050 c. or more, more preferably 1,10 c. or more. the uper limit of heating temperature is 1,20 c. this is because the enrichment of the foregoing aloy elements becomes saturated at about 1,180 c. or more, and increasing the heating temperature at the expense of high fuel cost is not economicaly advantageous. the heating temperature is preferably 1,190 c. or les, more preferably 1,180 c. or les. heating time from 90 c. to heating temperature: at least 1.5 hours (prefered condition) in order to more efectively enrich elements such as cu, cr, sb, w in the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe, it is preferable to increase the heating time particularly above 90 c. specificaly, the enrichment of elements such as cu, cr, sb, and w becomes more notable when the time length of heating from 90 c. to the target heating temperature of bilet roling is at least 1.5 hours, regardles of the heating temperature of bilet roling. it is therefore preferable that the time length of heating from 90 c. to the heating temperature of bilet roling be at least 1.5 hours. the heating time is more preferably at least 2.0 hours. the uper limit of heating time is 3.0 hours because the efect becomes saturated with a heating time longer than 3.0 hours, and increasing the heating time longer than 3.0 hours is not economicaly advantageous in terms of expenses such as fuel cost. the cast piece of a rectangular cros section is hot roled (bilet roling) imediately after being heated to the target heating temperature in the 1,0 to 1,20 c. temperature region, preferably within 60 seconds after heating. the hot roling end temperature (bilet-roling end temperature) is not particularly limited. however, considering the roling load on a roling mil, the hot roling temperature end temperature (bilet-roling end temperature) is preferably 80 c. or more, more preferably 90 c. or more. the hot roling (bilet roling) is folowed by coling to rom temperature. as used herein, rom temperature means 25 c. the coling method is not particularly limited. typicaly, coling is achieved by air coling with, for example, a coling bed. however, coling may be achieved by weak water coling, in order to reduce the time to col to rom temperature, and to increase the number of roled pipes per hour. as used herein, air coling means natural coling that takes place without the use of any coling means. typicaly, the average coling rate of air coling is 1 c./s or les. in the case of continuous casting to a cast piece having a circular cros section, the cast piece is heated (cast-piece heat treatment) into a stel pipe material before roled into a stel pipe (tubing) . the heating temperature of the cast-piece heat treatment is as folows. heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment: 1,0 to 1,20 c. temperature region the cast-piece heat treatment adopts the same heating temperature as bilet roling to ensure the same efect. specificaly, when the heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment is les than 1,0 c., it is not posible to suficiently enrich elements such as cu, cr, sb, and w in the outer surface of the cast piece (cast-piece surface), and cu, cr, sb, and w canot have the required concentrations in the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe after the final stel pipe heat treatment. the heating temperature of the cast-piece heat treatment is therefore 1,0 c. or more. the heating temperature is preferably 1,050 c. or more, more preferably 1,10 c. or more. the uper limit of the heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment is 1,20 c. this is because the enrichment of the foregoing elements becomes saturated at about 1,180 c. or more, and increasing the heating temperature at the expense of high fuel cost is not economicaly advantageous. the heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment is preferably 1,190 c. or les, more preferably 1,180 c. or les. heating time from 90 c. to heating temperature: at least 1.5 hours (prefered condition) in order to more efectively enrich elements such as cu, cr, sb, w in the outer surface of the seamles stel pipe, it is preferable to increase the heating time particularly above 90 c. specificaly, the enrichment of elements such as cu, cr, sb, and w becomes more notable when the time length of heating from 90 c. to the target heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment is at least 1.5 hours, regardles of the heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment. it is therefore preferable that the time length of heating from 90 c. to the heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment be at least 1.5 hours. the heating time is more preferably at least 2.0 hours. the uper limit of heating time is 3.0 hours because the efect becomes saturated with a heating time longer than 3.0 hours, and increasing the heating time longer than 3.0 hours is not economicaly advantageous in terms of expenses such as fuel cost. in the cast-piece heat treatment proces, the cast piece having reached the target heating temperature is imediately taken out of the furnace, and coled to rom temperature. the coling method after the cast-piece heat treatment is not particularly limited. typicaly, coling is achieved by air coling with, for example, a coling bed. however, coling may be achieved by weak water coling, in order to reduce the time to col to rom temperature, and to increase the number of heat treatment pipes per hour. the stel pipe material after the bilet roling or cast-piece heat treatment is used to form a seamles stel pipe of a predetermined shape in a hot proces (tubing proces). in the tubing proces, the stel pipe material may be formed into a seamles stel pipe of a predetermined shape by a proces that hot rols the preheated stel pipe material (piercing folowed by mandrel mil roling or plug mil roling into a predetermined wal thicknes, and roling into an apropriately reduced diameter) . the heating temperature and hot roling temperature of the stel pipe material are as folows. stel pipe material heating temperature: 1,10 to 1,30 c. in the tubing proces, the stel pipe material is heated, and hot roled into a seamles stel pipe of a predetermined shape. in order to prevent defects, the stel pipe material is heated to a heating temperature of 1,10 c. or more because a stel pipe material heating temperature of les than 1,10 c. causes severe internal defects during piercing, and defects detected in a nondestructive testing after the final stel pipe heat treatment canot be removed even when the stel pipe is subjected to repair or finishing to make it aceptable. the stel pipe material heating temperature is preferably 1,150 c. or more, more preferably 1,20 c. or more. the uper limit of stel pipe material heating temperature is 1,30 c. because a stel pipe material heating temperature of more than 1,30 c. results in a los of stel surface by oxidation, and increased fuel costs, among other economic disadvantages. the stel pipe material heating temperature is preferably 1,290 c. or les, more preferably 1,280 c. or les. hot roling temperature: 80 c. or more with a roling temperature of hot roling (stel pipe roling) below 80 c., the high-temperature ductility of stel decreases, and defects ocur in outer surface during hot roling. the defects remain even after the stel pipe heat treatment, and defects detected in a nondestructive testing canot be removed even when the stel pipe is subjected to repair or finishing to make it aceptable. from the perspective of preventing defects, the hot roling temperature is 80 c. or more. that is, the hot roling (stel pipe roling) end temperature is 80 c. or more. for example, when the hot roling is a proces starting from piercing folowed by mandrel mil roling or plug mil roling and ending with diameter reduction roling, the roling end temperature of diameter reduction roling is 80 c. or more. the hot roling temperature is preferably 830 c. or more, more preferably 850 c. or more. the hot roling of the stel pipe is folowed by coling to rom temperature. the coling method is not particularly limited. typicaly, coling is achieved by air coling with, for example, a coling bed. however, coling may be achieved by weak water coling, in order to reduce the time to col to rom temperature, and to increase the number of roled pipes per hour. the seamles stel pipe coled to rom temperature after the tubing proces is subjected to a normalizing heat treatment (stel pipe heat treatment proces) . the purpose of the normalizing heat treatment is to adjust the hardnes of the seamles stel pipe to a predetermined strength suited for piping. the heat treatment temperature (normalizing temperature) of the normalizing heat treatment is as folows. normalizing temperature: 850 to 1,050 c. when the normalizing temperature of normalizing heat treatment is les than 850 c., transformation into austenite does not proced to completion in part of the stel, and untransformed ferite and perlite persist in stel structure at high temperature. because the ferite and perlite structure causes decrease of stel strength, the normalizing temperature is 850 c. or more. the normalizing temperature is preferably 80 c. or more, more preferably 90 c. or more. with a normalizing temperature of more than 1,050 c., serious grain growth ocurs after transformation into austenite, and coarse ferite grains are formed by transformation in the course of coling after the normalizing heat treatment, with the result that the yield strength decreases. for this reason, the normalizing temperature is 1,050 c. or les. the normalizing temperature is preferably 1,0 c. or les, more preferably 950 c. or les. preferably, the coling after the normalizing heat treatment is air coling with, for example, a coling bed. when coling is achieved by weak water coling to increase the number of roled pipes per hour, it is preferable to start the coling proces from 50 c. or les, a temperature suficiently lower than the temperature at the end of transformation. examples molten stels of the compositions shown in tables 1 and 2 were made by a method using a converter, and were each cast into a cast piece by continuous casting. in continuous casting, some stels were cast into cast pieces having a rectangular cros section (30 m in thicknes40 m in width) while the others were cast into cast pieces having a circular cros section (190 m in diameter). the cast piece having a rectangular cros section was heated at a predetermined heating temperature, and hot roled into a stel pipe material (bilet-roled stel pipe material) measuring 190 m or 140 m in diameter. seamles stel pipes made from such a stel pipe material are denoted as bilet roled under the heading type of stel pipe material in tables 3, 4, and 5. the heating temperature, the heating time from 90 c. to heating temperature, and the bilet-roling end temperature of bilet roling are as shown in tables 3, 4, and 5. the cast piece having a circular cros section was prepared into a stel pipe material by cast-piece heat treatment, except for some comparative materials. stel pipes produced from the stel pipe material obtained by cast-piece heat treatment are denoted as cast-piece heat treatment under the heading type of stel pipe material in tables 3, 4, and 5. seamles stel pipes produced for comparison without cast-piece heat treatment are denoted as as-cast under the heading type of stel pipe material in tables 3, 4, and 5. the heating temperature, and the heating time from 90 c. to heating temperature of cast-piece heat treatment are as shown in tables 3, 4, and 5. these stel pipe materials were used to form seamles stel pipes of the wal thickneses and outer diameters shown in tables 3, 4, and 5 (tubing proces) . here, the stel pipe material was heated, and subjected to hot roling in a proces starting from piercing folowed by mandrel mil roling and ending with diameter reduction roling. the heating temperature and hot roling end temperature of stel pipe material, and the coling conditions after hot roling are as shown in tables 3, 4, and 5. this was folowed by a stel pipe heat treatment performed under the stel pipe heat treatment conditions shown in tables 3, 4, and 5. after the stel pipe heat treatment, the stel pipe was alowed to col to rom temperature, and subjected to a nondestructive testing to check for defects in iner and outer surfaces of the stel pipe. the presence or absence of defects, and the suces or failure of defect removal by repair are indicated under the heading pipe defect in tables 6, 7, and 8. the evaluation result is excelent when there was no defect in a nondestructive testing, satisfactory when defects were observed in a nondestructive testing but the required criteria were satisfied after repair, and fail when defects were observed in a nondestructive testing, and repair was imposible or the required criteria were not satisfied even after repair. stel pipes with excelent or satisfactory were regarded as having desirable manufacturability, with the former being more desirable. the term repair means removing scratch and other defects using, for example, a cuting device. an epma asay sample, a tensile test specimen, and a corosion test specimen for a corosion test in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment were taken from the seamles stel pipe produced above. an epma asay sample was prepared by taking a cros section orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of stel pipe to provide a measurement surface, and polishing the surface to a miror finish. in epma, the sample was measured in a 2-m region lying on the outer surface side of stel pipe toward the center of the wal thicknes of stel pipe at an acelerating voltage of 20 kv and a beam curent of 0.5 a with a beam size of 10 m. the measurement was made in a 2-m region at the outer surface of stel pipe because the composition of corosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment coresponds to the concentrations of the aloy elements that disolve out when corosion ocurs in this region of stel pipe in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment. the measurement was made for cu, cr, sb, and w. tungsten was measured only in stel nos. r, s, t, v, w, and am to which w was actively aded. the concentration (mas %) was calculated using a standard curve created in advance from the characteristic x-ray intensity of each element. specificaly, the concentration (mas %) was measured for each of cu, cr, sb, and w at seven locations in 0.25-m intervals in a region 0.5 to 2.0 m away from the outer surface toward the center of the wal thicknes of stel pipe, and the arithmetic mean value of the measured concentrations was determined as the average concentration of each element [cu*, cr*, sb*, or w*] in mas %. cu*, cr*, sb*, and w* are presented in tables 6, 7, and 8. the tables also show values on the left-hand side of formulae (1) and (2) calculated from cu*, cr*, sb*, and w* . in acordance with aspects of the present invention, the aceptable range of the values is 13.5 or more, preferably 14.0 or more, more preferably 15.0 or more. the 0.5-m region just below the outer surface of the stel pipe was excluded from the measurement region because an acurate line analysis canot be expected from a region this close to the sample surface. a tensile test specimen was taken from arbitrarily chosen longitudinal and circumferential locations of the stel pipe. stel pipes with an outer diameter of les than 170 m were prepared into test specimens acording to jis z241 12b, whereas stel pipes with an outer diameter of 170 m or more were prepared into test specimens acording to jis z241 12c. the tensile test was conducted acording to jis 241. the yield strength and tensile strength obtained in the tensile test are shown in tables 6, 7, and 8. stel pipes were determined as being aceptable when the yield strength was 230 mpa or more, and the tensile strength was 380 mpa or more. the yield strength is preferably 250 mpa or more, and the tensile strength is preferably 40 mpa or more. for the corosion test performed in a sulfuric acid dew-point environment, a corosion test specimen (30 m in length 20 m in width5 m in thicknes) including an outer surface of stel pipe was taken from the outer surface side of stel pipe, and a surface coresponding to the outer surface side of stel pipe was ground by 0.5 m to remove unwanted components such as scale. the exfoliation of corosion products produced in a sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test was evaluated using the procedures schematicaly represented in fig. 1 1 1 2 i 2 1 2 i 2 1 i i 
 i i the results are presented in tables 6, 7, and 8. stel pipes were determined as being aceptable when the exfoliation rate of corosion products was 10% or les. the exfoliation rate of corosion products is preferably 8% or les, more preferably 5% or les.

 underline means outside of the range of the present invention. in present examples (stel pipe nos. 1-1 to 1-2) in which the stel compositions and manufacturing conditions were within the ranges acording to aspects of the present invention, and that satisfied the requirement for formula (1) or (2) acording to aspects of the present invention, defects were not observed in iner and outer surfaces of the stel pipe. even when present, the defects were minor, and the stel pipes had desirable manufacturability by satisfying the required criteria after repair. the stel pipes of the present examples also satisfied the yield strength and tensile strength required as seamles stel pipes for piping, and had desirable sulfuric acid dew-point corosion resistance with an exfoliation rate of corosion products of 10% or les observed after imersion in a sulfuric acid dew-point corosive environment for 96 hours. in contrast, defects were observed in the outer surface of the stel pipe in the nondestructive testing in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-24) in which the c content in the stel exceded the uper limit of the range of the present invention, comparative example (stel pipe no.

criteria with the defects remaining even after repair. similarly, in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-34) in which the ni content in the stel was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, defects were observed in the outer surface of the stel pipe in the nondestructive testing, and the stel pipe did not have desired manufacturability by failing to satisfy the required criteria with the defects remaining even after repair. defects were observed in the nondestructive testing after piercing in the roling of the stel pipe in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-28) in which the mn content in the stel exceded the uper limit of the range of the present invention, comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-30) in which the p content exceded the uper limit of the range of

invention. the defects are probably due to the centerline segregation of the aloy elements exceding the uper limits of the ranges of the present invention. in these comparative examples, the stel pipe did not have desired manufacturability by failing to satisfy the required criteria even after repair. the yield strength and tensile strength failed to met the target values in the tensile test in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-25) in which the c content in the stel was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-27) in which the si content was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, and in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-29) in which the mn content was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention. severe corosion ocured in the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test, and the stel pipe failed to satisfy the target exfoliation rate of corosion products in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-3) in which the cu content in the stel was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, and in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-38) in which the sb content was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention. in comparative example (stel pipe no. 1-36) in which the cr content in the stel was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, the stel pipe failed to satisfy the target exfoliation rate of corosion products in the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test. the stel pipe did not satisfy the requirement for formula (1) acording to aspects of the present invention, and the exfoliation rate of corosion products failed to met the target value in the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test in comparative examples (stel pipe nos. 2-1, 2-5, and 2-10) in which the stel composition satisfied the range acording to aspects of the present invention but the heating temperature of the bilet roling or cast-piece heat treatment performed after continuous casting was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention. similarly, the stel pipe did not satisfy the requirement for formula (2) acording to aspects of the present invention, and the exfoliation rate of corosion products failed to met the target value in the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test in comparative example (stel pipe no. 2-8) in which the heating temperature of the bilet roling after continuous casting was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention. the stel pipe did not satisfy the requirement for formula (1) or (2) acording to aspects of the present invention, and the exfoliation rate of corosion products failed to met the target value in the sulfuric acid dew-point corosion test in comparative example (stel pipe no. 2-4, 2-9, 2-1) in which the stel pipe was produced by the tubing and stel pipe heat treatment of as-cast stel pipe material without bilet roling or cast-piece heat treatment after continuous casting. coarsening of stel microstructure ocured in normalization, and the yield strength failed to achieve the target value in the tensile test in comparative examples (stel pipe nos. 2-2 and 2-6) in which the normalizing temperature of the normalizing heat treatment of stel pipe exceded the uper limit of the range of the present invention. in comparative examples (stel pipe nos. 2-3 and 2-7) in which the normalizing temperature of the normalizing heat treatment of stel pipe was below the lower limit of the range of the present invention, transformation into austenite did not ocur over the whole surface in normalization, and untransformed ferite and perlite partialy remained at high temperature, with the result that the yield strength and tensile strength failed to achieve the target values in the tensile test. reference signs list
