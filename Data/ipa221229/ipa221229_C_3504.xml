<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Metallic alloys containing one or more valuable elements are common. However, separation and purification of one or more of the elements in the alloy can be difficult or impossible. This can make recovery of certain elements from alloys in discarded materials impractical despite the high value and limited supply of certain elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Advances in microelectronic devices has hinged on unique properties of critical materials albeit each geared towards a specific function in these highly complex systems. Critical materials include rare-earth elements, platinum-group elements, and other elements such as antimony, beryllium, cesium, cobalt, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, niobium, tantalum, tellurium, and tungsten. Challenges in continued improvements, however, have been exacerbated by a quasi-monopolistic supply coupled with limits to availability of high concentration mineable ore(s). Recycling and upcycling are, therefore, a critical pathway to sustainability albeit most recycling approaches rely on either wasteful chemical leaching or smelting. These methods are based on Gibbsian thermodynamics and are therefore costly, inefficient, and energy intensive. The classical nature of current methods renders them untenable in recovery of low concentration species. These methods are also not selective and cannot, therefore, be used to target a low concentration, but high value, component of an alloy or mixed material system.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0060">Calculation of volumetric change due to phase transition. Volumetric changes during phase transition was calculated using values in Table 1. Assuming 1 g of starting material, volumes of each elements were calculated in proportion for each alloy. AV for each element can then be calculated by taking V<sub>sol</sub>-V<sub>hiq</sub>. Based on whether the material is contracting or expanding upon solidification, Contraction vs. expansion ratio (&#x394;V<sub>contract</sub>/&#x394;V<sub>expand</sub>) can be calculated to measure the amount of stress exerted during phase transition. For example, 1 g of Field's metal contain 0.51 g In, 0.325 g Bi and 0.165 g Sn. &#x394;V<sub>In </sub>after liquid-solid phase transition is &#x2212;2.8 mm<sup>3</sup>, whilst &#x394;V<sub>Sn</sub>=&#x2212;1.03 and &#x394;V<sub>Bi</sub>=0.90. Taking a total of the contracting elements (In and Sn) and dividing it with the expanding element (Bi) gives a contraction-expansion ratio of 4.34. Same concept can be applied to BiSn where it yields a ratio of 1.83. No ratio is found for InSn due to the lack of expanding element.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0061">SAXS dimensional analysis background. The existence of a diffuse boundary is observed where there is a negative deviation from the ideal Porod's law constant (&#x3b1;=4) on the slope of the scattering intensity (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>). The scattering vector q in these plots relates the scattering angle and the wavelength of the radiation used in this experiment (q=4&#x3c0; sin &#x3b8;/&#x3bb;), where &#x3b8; is half the scattering angle and &#x3bb; is the wavelength. The amount of deviation from the ideal exponent indicates that the electron density profile is not sharp, larger deviation can be suspected of thicker oxides. It can be seen that &#x3b1; increases as the particles are heated to 523 K (from &#x2212;4.33 to &#x2212;4.64), which indicates a growing oxide shell. The deviation, however, decreases as the particles reaches 773 K and even further to 1023 K, almost reaching the ideal value. We suspect that at 773 K, the oxide has reached a critical thickness to which it is no longer diffuse. This temperature also marks the emergence of the bismuth features (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>), which suggests that fracturing already occurs, meaning the oxides already lose plasticity. As the particles are continually heated, these features will grow larger as the oxide also grows thicker (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>5</b></figref><i>c</i>). At this point, the oxides would have formed larger crystalline structures that would no longer have a diffuse boundary with the bulk metal and thus the deviation disappears. Ruland's method was used to approximate the boundary thickness (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>7</b></figref><i>c</i>), the plot was created based on the relationship: I(q)=K<sub>p</sub>&#xb7;q<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>e<sup>(&#x2212;&#x3c3;</sup><sup><sub2>2</sub2></sup><sup>q</sup><sup><sub2>2</sub2></sup><sup>)</sup>, where &#x3c3; (the slope in this plot) is the standard deviation of a gaussian smoothing function and K<sub>p </sub>is the Porod's law constant, thickness of the oxide (t) can be calculated using the relationship: t=&#x221a;{square root over (2&#x3c0;&#x3c3;)}. From Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>, it can be approximated that the fresh oxide of the ULMCS is about &#x2dc;7.3 nm and it can grow up to &#x2dc;9.6 nm at 523 K. At 773 K and beyond, the plot displays a straight horizontal line, which gives no approximation of oxide thickness. With this information, it is safe to assume that the oxide will continually grow while heated, upon reaching a critical point, the oxide will undergo crystallization and form the large features shown in Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0062">Thin passivating surface oxide layers on metal alloys form a dissipation horizon between dissimilar phases, hence harbor an inherent free energy and composition gradient. We exploit this gradient to drive order and selective surface separation (speciation), enabling redox-driven enrichment of the core by selective conversion of low standard reduction potential (E<sup>O</sup>) components into oxides. Coupling this oxide growth to volumetric changes during solidification allows us to create oxide crystallites trapped in a metal (&#x2018;ship-in-a-bottle&#x2019;) or extrusion of metal fingerlings on the heavily oxidized particle. We confirm the underlying mechanism through high temperature X-ray diffraction and characterization of solidification-trapped particle states. We demonstrate that engineering the passivating surface oxide can lead to purification via selective dealloying with concomitant enrichment of the core, leading to disparate particle morphologies.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0063">Passivating metal oxides are paradoxical entities in that they offer protection from corrosion&#x2014;on condition that they do not spall or crack, but they deplete a metal (albeit minimally in most cases) and introduce interfaces with significantly different properties than the bulk. These oxides are a thermodynamically different entity from the bulk, yet at ambient are fixed component of the metal. Despite their small (nm) sizes, they have been utilized to stabilize metastable states or alter properties of liquid metals, leading to new unprecedented applications. Structural complexity in these nanoscale passivating oxide layers has, however, only been recently described albeit in liquid metals. Through felicitous choice of processing conditions, autonomous Thermal Oxidative Composition Inversion (TOCI) and surface texturing empirically confirmed this complexity and highlights underlying speciation (that is distribution and/or organization of alloy elements or mixed oxidation states) by externally exuding these gradients. By exploiting relation between mass and energy (E&#x221d;m), the composition gradient must lead to asymmetry in mass distribution hence a sharp energy gradient across the thin passivating layers. The energy gradient in turn can frustrate relaxation and equilibration leading to metastable material states. This ansatz has been demonstrated through stabilization of undercooled metal particles, that have enabled low-temperature metal processing. The inferences above, however, are premised on the outward growth of a thin (&#x3c;20 nm) passivating oxide layer that is, Cabrera-Mott type oxidation, but speciation under thicker (&#x3e;1 &#x3bc;m) oxide layers has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0064">Surface oxidation of metals is mechanistically understood as a thickness-dependent asymmetric flux process in that, initially metal ions and/or electrons flux/migrate to the oxide-ambient surface and/or oxidant diffuses towards the oxide-metal interface. The former is well captured by the Cabrera-Mott oxidation theory (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) and, as expected, is limited to thin (&#x3c;20 nm) oxide films. The latter dominates with thicker (&#x3e;1 &#x3bc;m) oxides as described by the Wagner's oxidation theory (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>). The intermediate region (20 nm&#x3c;thickness&#x3c;1 &#x3bc;m) has been captured as a rate-law differentiated transition regime (Xu-Rosso-Bruemmer postulate&#x2014;abbreviated XRB postulate, Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>). The Cabrera-Mott and Wagner oxidation regimes follow an inverse logarithmic and a parabolic growth rate law respectively. The transition regime, however, follows a direct logarithmic growth rate. Factors that determine direction of ionic diffusion during the oxidation event have been shown to heavily depend on the potential and mobility differences between the metal cations (M<sup>+</sup>) and oxygen anions (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>). Nature of atomic interactions, alloy composition, passivating oxide thickness and associated speciation, may also affect ionic diffusion. All these mechanisms, however, presume the existence of a native metal oxide film (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i></figref>). On a bare alloy surface, stoichiometry and stochasticity (equalling apriori probabilities for all alloy components to react) drive surface oxidation. This initial oxidation captures both composition and redox potential differences, setting up a surface speciation due to asymmetry in reactivity and diffusion (upon depletion of the topmost layer) that has not been captured until recently.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0065">We inferred that the proposed asymmetric ionic and oxidant diffusion (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i></figref>) should manifest as perturbations to the metal-oxide interfaces. In an alloy system, however, differences in standard reduction potential (E<sup>O</sup>) should induce a kinetically resolved differentiation and speciation. This differentiation in turn leads to concentration gradients across the oxide, with the surface being dominated by the most reactive component with concomitant enrichment of higher E<sup>O </sup>component(s) at the metal-oxide interface. This ansatz, however, hinges on unrestricted diffusion of the alloy components&#x2014;hence, the need for high plasticity at the metal-oxide interface. Liquid metals offer such an interface and are therefore ideal testbeds for this hypothesis. A caveat with liquid metals, however, is that surface plasticity and the fluidic state renders post speciation characterization challenging. Coupling this process to a phase change, however, arrests the metallic components in a form that cannot reconstitute post synthesis. Introducing a solidification step also allows one to capture physical changes due to negative (e.g. in Bi rich phases) or positive (e.g. Sn) thermal expansion. In the former, surface features akin to those observed during TOCI, but in non-oxidized form, are expected irrespective of the oxide thickness. In the latter, under the Wagner oxidation regime and extended oxide growth, entrapment of oxide crystallites inside metals is expected&#x2014;akin to &#x2018;ship-in-a-bottle&#x2019;, as the metal solidifies around stalagmite/stalactite-like oxide protuberances. Depending on the orientation of the oxide crystallites relative to the molten component, the metal can solidify around the crystals leading to a tightly bound oxide-in-metal structure. With selective enrichment of the low E<sup>O </sup>element into the oxide, hence dealloying, we infer that growing oxide crystallites can be engulfed by a metallic component rich in higher E<sup>O </sup>component(s)&#x2014;a feat that is otherwise impossible especially at the nano- to meso-scale. This speciation, however, hinges on the inward growth of the crystallites (Wagner regime) hence the oxide layer needs to be significantly thick. We infer that this will likely occur for alloys with significantly larger amounts of the lower E<sup>O </sup>component. Beside growth kinetics, thermo-expansive work (thermal fatigue) initiated defects also affects resultant mass distribution, and uniform oxide growth.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0066">Recent advances in the understanding of surface speciation during the oxidation process further suggest that the evolution of the surface oxide may lead to bulk or subsurface enrichment in the higher E<sup>O </sup>component of the alloy. This autonomous speciation also manifests in the evolution in composition of surface oxides on liquid metal particles (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>). We infer that this auto-speciation can lead to surface-driven de-alloying, hence changes in the bulk composition. In the case of negative thermal expansion core, the enriched component will stress and may break through the oxide shell on solidification, presenting metallic features on the surface&#x2014;that is, an inversion in component distribution (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>, top). Where phase change leads to contraction of the core, the oxide implodes (ductile shell) or cracks (brittle shell) trapping a metallic component (Martin at Figure if, bottom). Herein, we demonstrate these phase-change arrested configurations through felicitous choice of alloys and processing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0067">Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE). Field's metal (Bi: 32.5, In: 51, Sn: 16.5 wt %, or Bi: 21, In: 60.1, Sn: 18.8 at %, T<sub>m</sub>=335 K) shows positive volumetric thermal expansion (+&#x3b2;, PTE), while Bi (highest E<sup>O </sup>element) shows a negative thermal expansion (&#x2212;&#x3b2;, NTE). We inferred that controlled dealloying by growth of the passivating oxidation deep into the Wagner regime, at T&#x3e;T<sub>m</sub>, would lead to In (E<sub>In</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.34, |&#x3b2;<sub>in</sub>|=33&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and Sn (E<sub>Sn</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.14, |&#x3b2;<sub>Sn</sub>|=22&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) oxides with concomitant enrichment of Bi (E<sub>Sn</sub><sup>O</sup>=0.32, |&#x3b2;<sub>Bi</sub>|=13.2&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>K<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) in the liquid core due to its comparatively higher positive E<sup>O </sup>(Table 1). Compared to the commonly used gallium based liquid metals where the surface is highly dominated by the gallium oxide species (&#x2dc;0.7-2 nm), undercooled Field's metal's oxide layer tends to be slightly thicker (&#x2dc;4-5 nm), hence transition out of the Cabrera-Mott regime is likely to occur faster. Upon solidification, Bi expands while the oxides contract leading to exudates of solidifying Bi-rich phase (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>, top). To illustrate this dealloying/purification, speciation, and solidification-driven inversion of component distribution, undercooled Field's metal particles were synthesized using the SLICE (Shearing Liquid Into Complex particlEs) method (see, I. D. Tevis, L. B. Newcomb and M. Thuo, <i>Langmuir, </i>2014, 30, 14308-14313, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The particles were &#x2dc;1.01+1.35 &#x3bc;m in diameter with solidification temperature of 224 K (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>1</b></figref>). These particles bear a thin (&#x3c;5 nm) deformable oxide shell akin to oxidation in the Cabrera-Mott regime. For clarity, all particle images are false colored (see SI for non-colorized version) to highlight evolution in surface features. These particles were heated under low oxygen (&#x2264;10 ppm) over 573-1273 K range and samples were characterized at 100 K increments (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>2</b></figref>). For comparison, the particles were heated continuously at (10 K/min) to the target temperature with equilibration time, t<sub>c</sub>, =0, 15, 30 or 45 mins (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b></figref> and S<b>2</b>). Deformation and cracks are observed when particles are heated to 573 K and t<sub>e</sub>=0 mins (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>). The extent and distribution of these fractures is exacerbated for t<sub>e</sub>=30 mins (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><sub>ii</sub>). These features are in part due to effect of thermal expansivity of a fragile oxide shell. We infer that thicker oxide shells would retain their shape and dissipate stress through cracks, fractures or spalling, increasing oxidant permeability or if core is liquidus and under tension, extrude underlying/bulk components as observed in TOCI. When particles were heated to 773 K and t<sub>e</sub>=0 mins, Bi rich surface features appear (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i><sub>i</sub></figref>), suggesting that the core is rich in Bi. Formation of Bi-rich features is enhanced at t=30 mins (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><sub>ii</sub>). Similarly, at T=873 K and t<sub>e</sub>=0 mins an increase in the number of Bi-rich surface features increases, while at T=873 K and t<sub>e</sub>=30 mins leads to increase in the size (length and/or width) of these surface features (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>and S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0068">At 873 K and t<sub>e</sub>=30 mins, we observe that particles that evolve fewer surface features grow a dendrite-like structure (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><sub>ii</sub>), confirming that these features emanate from stress dissipation from the bulk. Given that these features are rich in Bi, an NTE element, vindicates mismatch in thermal expansivity&#x2014;and associated stresses in this evolution (Table 1). To confirm that these features are related to solidification and originate in the core, first, we sequentially sectioned a particle from the edge through the core (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>e </i></figref>and S<b>3</b>). We observed that, as hypothesized, these features originate from or are connected to the core and are released to the surface via fissure-like paths (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>e</i></figref>). We infer that Bi is likely nucleating at the core and, during solidification, induces a solidification-driven mechanical tension due to phase change, &#x3c3;<sub>PT</sub>, leading to extrusion of the core with cooling and further solidification. Contraction of the oxide shell with cooling exacerbates &#x3c3;<sub>PT </sub>leading to fracture-driven stress dissipation. We infer that more Bi-rich exudates, albeit smaller in size, occur when multiple release points are formed on the oxide, otherwise the Bi features are larger when the release points are limited (conservation of matter). To confirm this inference, we sectioned two particles processed under the same conditions (T=873 K and t<sub>e</sub>=30 mins) but differing in the size, shape and number of surface features (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>3</b></figref>). We observe that irrespective of the morphology of the features, they originate from the core and are released via fissures forming across the oxide shell. In the absence of the surface features (T=573 K), however, a cross-section of the particle shows no centrally placed composition dissimilar feature (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>4</b></figref>). Similarly, when compared to a solid particle derived from the SLICE method, only expected spinodal patterns are observed (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>5</b></figref>) as previously observed. These control experiments support the inference that the observed features, speciation, and surface texture changes are not due to the particle preparation method but are due to increased oxidation and solidification of a liquid core.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0069">Compositional mapping using Energy Dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) reveals that the exudates are rich in Bi while the rest of the particle is rich in In&#x2014;Sn. Low oxygen concentration in the exudates suggesting that they are likely metallic Bi that oxidizes upon extrusion (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>and S<b>6</b>). To closely understand these temperature dependent changes, we characterized the process using: i) coupled Differential Scanning Calorimetry-Thermogravimetric Analysis and InfraRed-Mass Spectrometry (DSC-TGA-IR-MS) and ii) High Temperature X-Ray Diffraction (HTXRD). The DSC-TGA-IR-MS captures mass and energy change with temperature while concomitantly characterizing volatile gases exudates by IR and MS, allowing us to compare the underlying process to the recently reported TOCI. Evolution in the identity and/or crystallinity of the surface oxide is captured via HTXRD. Minor (&#x2dc;1.4%) and major (&#x2dc;14.5%) exothermic mass gain events are observed at ca. 473 K and 773 K respectively (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). These events are analogous to previous patterns observed with other liquid metals. The minor peak at (&#x2dc;450-550 K) leads to a spike in gaseous exudates as captured by the Gram-Schmidt plot (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). Since the minor peak corresponds to an MS spectrum dominated by m/z=44 amu (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>7</b></figref><i>a</i>), we infer a likely loss of surface ligand with concomitant increase in oxide growth as previously observed. The major peak (&#x2dc;600-800 K) is likely a continuous oxide growth as no volatile exudates are captured in the Gram Schmidt plot, MS, and IR spectra (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figures S<b>7</b></figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>). The mass increase plateaus at &#x2dc;800 K suggesting a change in the oxidation rate. Interestingly, these temperatures coincide with formation of cracks and Bi-rich surface features on the particles that are cooled back to ambient.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0070">To confirm that the oxide shell is growing and playing a critical role, we estimate changes in thickness using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) dimensional analysis through Ruland's method. Existence of a diffuse boundary correlates with a negative deviation from ideal Porod's law constant (&#x3b1;=4), where a is the negative power of the scattering vector q, to which the scattered intensity I(q) is proportional (q<sup>&#x2212;&#x3b1;</sup>&#x221d;I(q)). These values are obtained through curve fitting and correspond to the slope of In I vs. In q (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>). It can be seen that |&#x3b1;| increases as the particles are heated to 523 K (from 4.33 to 4.64), indicating a growing oxide shell. The deviation, however, decreases as the particles reaches 773 K and even further to 1023 K, almost reaching the ideal value. We infer that at 773 K, the oxide has reached a critical thickness upon which it is no longer diffuse or a second process (e.g., sintering or crystallization) counters any increase in thickness due to continued oxidation. Alternatively, the oxides likely form large crystalline structures (Wagner's regime) hence lack a diffuse boundary with the bulk metal hence no deviation in the scattering plot. Approximation of the boundary thickness was done using Ruland's method (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>7</b></figref><i>c</i>) where it displays &#x2dc;7 nm thick passivating oxide shell at ambient that grows to &#x2dc;10 nm at 523 K. At 773 K and beyond, the plot displays a straight horizontal line, which gives no approximation of oxide thickness (oxide is too thick). We can therefore infer that at 773 K the oxidation is no longer in the Cabrera-Mott regime, but most likely transitioned to the Wagner regime, which is also indicated by the rapid mass growth between 600 and 800 K (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). Based on the mechanism of the Wagner regime, non-uniform growth of the oxide is likely as surface defects increases access of oxidant diffusion into the oxide-metal interface leading to loss of the diffuse interfacial boundary and localized accelerated growth of oxide crystallites. This inference would lead to stalagmite-stalactite like structures growing into the molten metal core with concomitant continued E<sup>O</sup>-dependent dealloying as components oxidize and nucleate onto these crystallites. The interior of the particle, therefore, adopts a liquid-filled speleothem-like (cave-like) formation at high temperatures. Upon cooling, and solidification, the final structure depends on whether the core is an NTE or PTE component.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0071">To further support this claim, we monitored oxide growth via in-situ HTXRD. Samples were heated at 10 K/min and analyzed at increments of 50 K&#x2014;with the sample allowed to equilibrate for &#x2dc;20 minutes at each stage while the diffraction pattern is obtained. Using the as-prepared particles as a control, we monitored crystallization of the oxide shell. Fitting the emerging peaks to known oxides informed our inferences as to which component is crystalizing at what temperature (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). Obtained data complements TGA-IR-MS in that two transition points are observed during heating. The amorphous material shows no significant change in the diffraction patterns up to &#x2dc;523 K. For Field's metal, peaks aligning with In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>are the first to emerge, further supporting previous spectroscopic (auger and x-ray photo-electron)- and indirect empirical (TOCI)-based inferences on redox-driven surface speciation. These peaks continue to grow in intensity up to 773 K where SnO<sub>2 </sub>peaks emerge. Similarly, these data agree with previous SEM, TGA-IR-MS-DSC and SAXS analysis. Alongside the SnO<sub>2 </sub>formation at 773 K, a small peak associated with Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is observed. Surprisingly, this peak further increases upon cooling the sample indicating continued growth of the bismuth oxide. This increased growth occurs alongside appearance of Bi (012, 111 and 104) peaks further suggesting that as Bi solidifies, it is being extruded which upon oxidation leads to enhanced Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>peaks. This data leads us to infer that the exudates are a consequence of solidification of an NTE component in a tightly closed shell. When the sample is cooled to room temperature all peaks experience a small shift due to thermal contraction. From the data above we confirm; i) selectivity in the formation of the oxide components correlates to redox potential (E<sub>In</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.34&#x3c;E<sub>Sn</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.14&#x3c;E<sub>Bi</sub><sup>O</sup>=0.32) and not stoichiometrically (In&#x3e;Bi&#x3e;Sn) suggesting a redox-driven speciation/differentiation, ii) confirms TOCI, iii) a two-step oxidation process in the formation of the oxide shell, iv) the native oxide in Field's metal liquid particles is thin (&#x3c;10 nm) but grows with heating, and v) the Bi surface features are extruded upon cooling with concomitant surface oxidation of the metal.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0072">Based on the oxidation theories (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i></figref>) there is a possibility of creating an oxide shell in the Wagner regime where increase in oxidation does not lead to tight uniform growth on the inside due to localized growth of the oxide crystals. This would result in an oxide shell on the thermally expanded metal surface leading to an oxide shell that is larger than the solidified metal. In this case, there would be enough room for a solidifying NTE metal to remain in the now speleothem-like shell. Alternatively, enriching a higher E<sup>O </sup>PTE component can lead to similar entrapment. In both cases, the molten metal would freely flow over stalagmite-like features and with solidification would create oxide-metal-oxide features. To illustrate this ansatz, we treated BiSn and InSn like the Field's metal and analyzed their core structures.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0073">Furthermore, the chemical process of converting liquid metal to a solid through oxidation is well-understood. The process is diffusion-based for oxide metal layers of sufficient thickness, i.e., the Wagner regime. In this region the growth rate is proportional to an oxidizer concentration gradient across the oxide metal layer. Thus, the bulk liquid metal removal rate for the fastest oxidizing metal is proportional to the oxide layer growth rate and the oxidant concentration gradient, which decreases as the oxide layer grows. This may lead one to believe the fastest reacting metal oxide layer growth should be self-limiting as the concentration gradient reduces. Mass transport in the bulk liquid metal phase is, however, also diffusion-limited due to the small length scales (small liquid volumes) discussed in this study. Therefore, the oxide layer growth rate and bulk removal are coupled. A balance between a bulk planar diffusion process and the interface (solid-liquid) concentration based growth rate would suggest D &#x2202;<sup>2</sup>c/&#x2202;x<sup>2</sup>=&#x2202;c/&#x2202;t (where D is fastest reacting bulk liquid metal diffusivity of concentration c) but with &#x2202;c/&#x2202;t&#x221d;&#x394;c<sub>ox</sub>/x (where &#x394;co<sub>x </sub>is the ambient oxidizer concentration) the removal of fastest oxidizing metal from the bulk suggests a logarithmic flux i.e. &#x2202;c/&#x2202;x &#x221d; ln x. Thus, the removal of the fastest oxidizing metal may be sustained throughout the growth process even when the identity of this species is changing with depletion of one alloy component. In light of this rate argument, sequential depletion of alloy components justifies the observed enrichment of the highest redox component in the bulk, allowing us to design a redox-based purification process.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0074">Ship in a Bottle. Particles of BiSn (eutectic, Bi:Sn 58:42 wt %, or 44:56 at %, T<sub>m</sub>=411 K) and InSn (eutectic, In:Sn 52:48 wt %, or 53:47 at %, T<sub>m</sub>=391 K) were prepared using the SLICE method. The particles were undercooled to 264 K (BiSn) and 335 K (InSn) ensuring a liquidus phase far below temperatures of interest (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>1</b></figref>). For the BiSn samples, we observed that upon heating to 773 K the particles appeared wrinkled with minimal emergent surface texturing (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>). Further heating to 873 K (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>) or higher (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>8</b></figref>) increases wrinkling of the shell with analogous two-step transition events as with Field's metal, albeit at different temperatures (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>8</b></figref><i>e</i>). Examining the cross-section of these particles reveals a trapped Bi-rich core albeit with significant void volume (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>, S<b>9</b>, and S<b>10</b>) suggesting that the observed wrinkling was due to thermal contraction. Unlike in ambient liquid metal particles that only develop a hollow core upon complete oxidation, the growth of crystallites, solidification, and concomitant separation/speciation triggers asymmetry in expansive work enabling formation of voids. Furthermore, BiSn contains high level of Bi (higher E<sup>O</sup>) and thus depletion of the readily oxidizing component (Sn) is further enhanced, whilst Bi stays in the core. In this case, therefore, stoichiometry surpasses effect of thermal expansivity observed with Field's metal. Elemental analysis reveals the shell and growing crystallites to be predominantly SnO<sub>2</sub>. To further confirm these changes, HTXRD analysis of the particles showed poor crystallinity in the as-synthesized BiSn particles with SnO/SnO<sub>2 </sub>peaks becoming prominent at 773 K albeit with concomitant generation of yet to be assigned peaks (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>11</b></figref><i>a</i>). As expected, diffraction peaks increase with continued heating. The enrichment indicates a clear separation/dealloying of the material with higher E<sup>O </sup>(E<sub>Bi</sub><sup>O</sup>=0.32, E<sub>Sn</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.14; &#x394;E<sup>O</sup>=0.46) component isolating into the core. Interestingly, and as hypothesized, we observe entrapment of a growing oxide crystallite by the metal, which we infer are forming upon cooling (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>). The observed engulfnent (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>) shows a growing crystal that was partially encumbered by the metal, indicating that it is possible to fully encapsulate a growing crystallite inside a metal where the proportion of the metal/enriched core phase is high. This hypothesis is, however, limited by stoichiometry and requires almost equivalent proportions of the two elements in the binary alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0075">Comparatively, BiSn has 12% more of the lower E<sup>O </sup>component and a large difference in redox potential (&#x394;E<sup>O</sup>=0.46), while InSn presents a narrower redox gap (E<sub>In</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.32, E<sub>Sn</sub><sup>O</sup>=&#x2212;0.14, &#x394;E<sup>O</sup>=0.18) and only a slight (6%) enrichment in the lower E<sup>O </sup>component. In this case, we anticipate that surface oxidation in the Wagner regime would lead to significant growth of the dominant oxidizing species in the form of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>crystallites and/or a thick oxide shell with Sn-rich phase trapped in the core. We observe that InSn particle show significant thermal stress spallation when heated to 773 k (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>) and 873 K (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>13</b>). Cross-section of these particles reveal a &#x2018;ship-in-a-bottle&#x2019; in that the oxide is completely engulfed in the Sn-metal&#x2014;an advanced stage of engulfment compared to that observed in BiSn. Elemental analysis by EDS (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>f</i></figref>) confirms the distribution of the components. Given that these particles undercool down to 335 K, XRD diffraction patterns of the control reveal presence of In, Sn and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>with SnO/SnO<sub>2 </sub>diffraction peaks only appearing after heat-treatment (Martin at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.

<p id="p-0079" num="0076">Conclusions. This work demonstrates the controlled behaviour of surface oxidation in metals and its potential in design of new particle structures or purification/dealloying. By tuning oxidation via temperature, oxidant partial pressure, time and composition, a balance between reactivity and thermal deformation enables unprecedented morphologies. By trapping these features through solidification, we can stabilize them below the materials melting point. (1) Metals undergo extended multi-step oxidation processes with temperature. These stages are; i) the stochastic stoichiometric oxidation stage to create the first pre-Cabrera-Mott film, ii) the Cabrera-Mott regime, iii) the intermediate XRB regime, and iv) Wagner regime. All these stages depend on amount of existing oxide film except for the statistical mechanics driven initial state when the bare metal surface is exposed to the oxidant. (2) Despite changing mechanisms, we exploit these processes to selectively induce dealloying leading to speciation into the growing oxide and concomitant purification/isolation of the highest E<sup>O </sup>component to the core of the particle. Coupling the solidification to oxide growth leads to new particle morphologies analogous to macroscopic cave-formation (speleothem) albeit filled with the metal. (3) We paired oxidation rate laws to thermal expansivity to deploy alloy composition, stoichiometry and properties of the growing oxides to create dissimilar particle morphologies. For alloys where the NTE component has a significantly large &#x394;E<sup>O </sup>difference to the most reactive components and is a minor component of the alloy (e.g. Field's metal), depletion of other elements allows for the extrusion of this component upon solidification. On the contrary, where the concentration of the NTE component is high, inward growth of the oxide may be insufficient to occupy all the space occupied by the expanded metal (e.g. in BiSn). In this case the metal solidifies onto the growing crystallites leading to &#x2018;ship-in-a-bottle&#x2019; oxide-metal-oxide morphologies. (4) We also illustrate that although thermal expansivity is crucial, stoichiometric considerations may surpass asymmetry in volumetric changes as illustrated by Field's metal vs BiSn. A balance of total thermal expansive work is therefore essential in realizing the desired structures and/or morphologies.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0078">For the heating process, the elements being separated are dependent on the standard reduction potential (E<sup>0</sup>). Lower E<sup>0 </sup>elements would tend to oxidize whilst the others doesn't, separating the alloyin an oxide/pure element system.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="2">Shearing.</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0079">For the shearing process, the SLICE method was used with a BiGaIn alloy. Under extended period of shearing, the most reactive element (e.g., In) is continually be depleted, removing the element into the shearing solvent and shifting the alloy composition.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0080">The material was sheared for 10 minutes under a constant shear speed of 13000 rpm. Under an extended period of shearing, the most reactive component (In) was continually being depleted at a steady linear rate. Extreme shear speed also had an effect (at 17000 rpm) although it had a less significant effect than time, showing that this is a kinetic phenomena. Further proof of composition shifting was seen in a DSC plot as the melting point of the alloy with lower indium content had shifted by &#x2dc;20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0081">An EDS map of the sheared BiGaIn alloy showed a very discreet alloy separation of eutecticBiGaIn under shear stress. This process relies on the miscibility of the components making the alloy. Gallium and indium are very miscible and create a very low energy eutectic alloy (EGaIn) whilst bismuth is not very miscible with the two. Shearing this alloy gives enough kinetic energy for these elements to scramble and form their low energy states. The formed particles are very distinct from each other (as seen in the EDS Map, and also from the distinct melting points of each respective resulting alloy).</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="2">Heat/Oxidation-Based Separation.</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>E</figref> illustrate schematics of various heat/oxidation-based separations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>D, and <b>1</b>F</figref> illustrate SEM images of particles having been subjected to the heat/oxidation based separation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>E</figref>, respectively.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, showing a BiSn alloy, when the oxide reaches a certain threshold, the kinetics of oxidation shifts to the core. This induces oxidation in the core whilst depleting the most reactive element, creating cavities with oxide crystals in the core.

<heading id="h-0013" level="2">Laser Irradiation.</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0085">For the photon reaction, the reactivity is dependent on different factors.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0086">Absorption coefficient defines how much light of a certain color is absorbed by the alloy. The higher numbers indicate that it will absorb higher wavelength colors (more red) and lower number indicate lower wavelength (more blue-purple). The reactivity of the electron configuration on certain elements depends on the polarizability. Elements such as bismuth and gold tend to have higher polarizability due to their tight electron configuration (lanthanide contraction, many overlapping accessible higher orbital states), thus under given photon energy supply, it is easier for these element to react.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0087">In the method, the particles are irradiated with a laser to alter the oxidation profile of the metal elements in the alloy. In this case a higher E<sup>0 </sup>element, with accessible electronic transitions under applied light frequency, oxidizes first leading to its selective removal from the mixed metals as nanoparticle plumes. Then, the plumes are harvested to recover the oxidized species. The laser can be tuned to control which component gets oxidized (i.e., use a frequency that allows electronic transitions/excitation in a given metal). This renders that metal more susceptible to oxidation (that potential leads to surface diffusion and rapid oxidation). The lowest E<sup>0 </sup>component is left on the surface, since it is part of the native passivating oxide. By using a combination of thermally- and optically-driven separation, a target element can be selectively removed from an alloy mixture. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate schematics of a laser-based separation process. The grown particle is oversaturated and the most laser reactive element diffuses towards the surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, oversaturation leads to an explosion of the grown particle, and the energy released drives the distribution of plume toward the perimeter from the center of area-of-effect. The released plume is then harvested via a suction apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0088">A vacuum line can be used to suck away the plumes as they are generated. Only very low vacuum is needed (e.g., from 735 mmHg and below is the vacuum is about 1 cm from the surface of the metal. The vacuum can be applied using the tip of a Pasteur pipette to draw the plume into a tube on which a glass wool has been placed to trap the powder. Unless otherwise indicated, this is the plume-harvesting technique used in these Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0089">The further distance from the surface, the higher a vacuum power is needed. The vacuum stream can also be fed into a u-tube glass including appropriate filters or porous media to trap the particles. In another example, the vacuumed particles can be passed over a charged surface allowing the particles to be electrostatically trapped onto the walls of the charged surface. Where the surface is curved (e.g., a curved tube), the particles will also be separated by size with the largest particles sticking to the tube early and the smallest running the furthest. The harvested plumes can also be passed through a gas bubbler containing a solution of an appropriate ligand, e.g., oleylamine, that stabilizes the particles and limits sintering.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0090">We have demonstrated the process with computer hard drives and NdB magnets. Initial studies with rare-earths (erbium and halfnium) shows that the pure elements readily convert to oxides in the form of plumes.</p>
