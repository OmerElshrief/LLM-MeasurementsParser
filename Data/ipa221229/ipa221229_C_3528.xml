<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the disclosure generally relate to methods of forming transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). In particular, embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods of forming TMDC films for memory and logic applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor processing industry continues to strive for larger production yields while increasing the uniformity of layers deposited on substrates having larger surface areas. These same factors in combination with new materials also provide higher integration of circuits per unit area of the substrate. As circuit integration increases, the need for greater uniformity and process control regarding layer thickness rises. As a result, various technologies have been developed to deposit layers on substrates in a cost-effective manner, while maintaining control over the characteristics of the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is one of the most common deposition processes employed for depositing layers on a substrate. CVD is a flux-dependent deposition technique that requires precise control of the substrate temperature and the precursors introduced into the processing chamber in order to produce a desired layer of uniform thickness. These requirements become more critical as substrate size increases, creating a need for more complexity in chamber design and gas flow technique to maintain adequate uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variant of CVD that demonstrates excellent step coverage is cyclical deposition or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Cyclical deposition is based upon atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and employs chemisorption techniques to deliver precursor molecules on a substrate surface in sequential cycles. The cycle exposes the substrate surface to a first precursor, a purge gas, a second precursor and the purge gas. The first and second precursors react to form a product compound as a film on the substrate surface. The cycle is repeated to form the layer to a desired thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The advancing complexity of advanced microelectronic devices is placing stringent demands on currently used deposition techniques. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of viable chemical precursors available that have the requisite properties of robust thermal stability, high reactivity, and vapor pressure suitable for film growth to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are known to be great candidates to mitigate the issue of metal migration associated with interconnect downscaling of films. Moreover, TMDC possess better conductivity and carrier mobility compared to current processes in 3D NAND devices. Recent TMDC methods require high temperature processes which may not be compatible with device thermal budgets.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is, therefore, a need in the art for TMDC that can be grown at a lower temperature suitable for device integration in temperature sensitive structures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Before describing several exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not limited to the details of construction or process steps set forth in the following description. The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a surface, or portion of a surface, upon which a process acts. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that reference to a substrate can also refer to only a portion of the substrate unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Additionally, reference to depositing on a substrate can mean both a bare substrate and a substrate with one or more films or features deposited or formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; means that there is less than less than about 5%, including less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, and less than about 0.5% of oxygen, on an atomic basis, in the transition metal dichalcogenide film.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; as used herein, refers to any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which film processing is performed during a fabrication process. For example, a substrate surface on which processing can be performed include materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, strained silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, amorphous silicon, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, semiconductor wafers. Substrates may be exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate, anneal, UV cure, e-beam cure and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to film processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in the present disclosure, any of the film processing steps disclosed may also be performed on an underlayer formed on the substrate as disclosed in more detail below, and the term &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include such underlayer as the context indicates. Thus, for example, where a film/layer or partial film/layer has been deposited onto a substrate surface, the exposed surface of the newly deposited film/layer becomes the substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, a &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; refers to any substrate surface upon which a layer may be formed. The substrate surface may have one or more features formed therein, one or more layers formed thereon, and combinations thereof. The substrate (or substrate surface) may be pretreated prior to the deposition of the transition metal dichalcogenide layer, for example, by polishing, etching, reduction, oxidation, halogenation, hydroxylation, annealing, baking, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The substrate may be any substrate capable of having material deposited thereon, such as a silicon substrate, a III-V compound substrate, a silicon germanium (SiGe) substrate, an epi-substrate, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, a display substrate such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display, an electro luminescence (EL) lamp display, a solar array, solar panel, a light emitting diode (LED) substrate, a semiconductor wafer, or the like. In some embodiments, one or more additional layers may be disposed on the substrate such that the transition metal dichalcogenide layer may be at least partially formed thereon. For example, in some embodiments, a layer comprising a metal, a nitride, an oxide, or the like, or combinations thereof may be disposed on the substrate and may have the transition metal dichalcogenide layer formed upon such layer or layers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one or more embodiments, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d;, with respect to a film or a layer of a film, includes the film or layer being directly on a surface, for example, a substrate surface, as well as there being one or more underlayers between the film or layer and the surface, for example the substrate surface. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;on the substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include one or more underlayers. In other embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; refers to a layer or a film that is in contact with a surface, for example, a substrate surface, with no intervening layers. Thus, the phrase &#x201c;a layer directly on the substrate surface&#x201d; refers to a layer in direct contact with the substrate surface with no layers in between.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one or more embodiments, the method uses an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. In such embodiments, the substrate surface is exposed to the precursors (or reactive gases) sequentially or substantially sequentially. As used herein throughout the specification, &#x201c;substantially sequentially&#x201d; means that a majority of the duration of a precursor exposure does not overlap with the exposure to a co-reagent, although there may be some overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactant&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably to refer to any gaseous species that can react with the substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">&#x201c;Atomic layer deposition&#x201d; or &#x201c;cyclical deposition&#x201d; as used herein refers to the sequential exposure of two or more reactive compounds to deposit a layer of material on a substrate surface. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;reactive compound&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive species&#x201d;, &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;process gas&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably to mean a substance with a species capable of reacting with the substrate surface or material on the substrate surface in a surface reaction (e.g., chemisorption, oxidation, reduction). The substrate, or portion of the substrate is exposed sequentially to the two or more reactive compounds which are introduced into a reaction zone of a processing chamber. In a time-domain ALD process, exposure to each reactive compound is separated by a time delay to allow each compound to adhere and/or react on the substrate surface. In a spatial ALD process, different portions of the substrate surface, or material on the substrate surface, are exposed simultaneously to the two or more reactive compounds so that any given point on the substrate is substantially not exposed to more than one reactive compound simultaneously. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; used in this respect means, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, that there is the possibility that a small portion of the substrate may be exposed to multiple reactive gases simultaneously due to diffusion, and that the simultaneous exposure is unintended.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one aspect of a time-domain ALD process, a first reactive gas (i.e., a first precursor or compound A) is pulsed into the reaction zone followed by a first time delay. Next, a second precursor or compound B is pulsed into the reaction zone followed by a second delay. During each time delay a purge gas, such as argon, is introduced into the processing chamber to purge the reaction zone or otherwise remove any residual reactive compound or by-products from the reaction zone. Alternatively, the purge gas may flow continuously throughout the deposition process so that only the purge gas flows during the time delay between pulses of reactive compounds. The reactive compounds are alternatively pulsed until a desired film or film thickness is formed on the substrate surface. In either scenario, the ALD process of pulsing compound A, purge gas, compound B and purge gas is a cycle. A cycle can start with either compound A or compound B and continue the respective order of the cycle until achieving a film with the desired thickness. In some embodiments, there may be two reactants, A and B, that are alternatingly pulsed and purged. In other embodiments, there may be three or more reactants, A, B, and C, that are alternatingly pulsed and purged.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an aspect of a spatial ALD process, a first reactive gas and second reactive gas (e.g., hydrogen radicals) are delivered simultaneously to the reaction zone but are separated by an inert gas curtain and/or a vacuum curtain. The substrate is moved relative to the gas delivery apparatus so that any given point on the substrate is exposed to the first reactive gas and the second reactive gas.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of the disclosure provide methods of forming high-quality transition metal dichalcogenide films in terms of crystallinity, grain size, continuity, and electrical conductivity for use as a channel material, liner or barrier layer in the miniaturization and scaling of integrated circuits. In one or more embodiments, the transition metal dichalcogenide films act as a barrier layer in logic devices. For example, the transition metal dichalcogenide film may act as a barrier layer between a copper layer and a cobalt layer in a logic device to prevent electromigration of copper atoms and cobalt atoms. In one or more embodiments, transition metal dichalcogenide films act as a liner in 3D NAND applications. For example, the transition metal dichalcogenide film acting as a liner may enable nucleation of a subsequently deposited metal, adhesively bind a metal to underlying dielectric materials, and block diffusion of elements to the underlying dielectric materials. In one or more embodiments, transition metal dichalcogenide films act as a channel material in 3D NAND applications. In one or more embodiments, transition metal dichalcogenide films have better carrier mobility than poly-silicon, as an example. The carrier mobility of the transition metal dichalcogenide films may improve 3D NAND device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the disclosure provide a low thermal budget approach to achieve high-quality 2D-transition metal dichalcogenide films for temperature-sensitive device architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a structure <b>100</b> including a substrate <b>110</b> having at least one feature <b>120</b> thereon is shown. The Figures show substrates having three features for illustrative purposes; however, those skilled in the art will understand that there can be more or less than three features. In one or more embodiments, the substrate <b>110</b> includes at least one feature <b>120</b>. The shape of the feature <b>120</b> can be any suitable shape including, but not limited to, trenches and cylindrical vias. As used in this regard, the term &#x201c;feature&#x201d; means any intentional surface irregularity. Suitable examples of features include but are not limited to trenches which have a top, two sidewalls and a bottom, and peaks which have a top and two sidewalls. Features can have any suitable aspect ratio (ratio of the depth of the feature to the width of the feature). In some embodiments, the aspect ratio is greater than or equal to about 5:1, 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, 25:1, 30:1, 35:1 or 40:1. In one or more embodiments, the at least one feature <b>120</b> is a trench.

As used in this manner, the term &#x201c;processing chamber&#x201d; also includes portions of a processing chamber adjacent the substrate surface without encompassing the complete interior volume of the processing chamber. For example, in a sector of a spatially separated processing chamber, the portion of the processing chamber adjacent the substrate surface is purged of the transition metal oxide precursor by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, moving the substrate through a gas curtain to a portion or sector of the processing chamber that contains none or substantially none of the transition metal precursor or, in some embodiments, the transition metal oxide precursor. In one or more embodiments, purging the processing chamber comprises applying a vacuum. In some embodiments, purging the processing chamber comprises flowing a purge gas over the substrate. In some embodiments, the portion of the processing chamber refers to a micro-volume or small volume process station within a processing chamber. The term &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; referring to the substrate surface means the physical space next to the surface of the substrate which can provide sufficient space for a surface reaction (e.g., precursor adsorption) to occur. In one or more embodiments, the purge gas is selected from one or more of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), helium (He), and argon (Ar).

In some embodiments, the chalcogenide reactant comprises a reducing agent. In one or more embodiments, the reducing agent can comprise any reducing agent known to one of skill in the art. In other embodiments, the chalcogenide reactant comprises an oxidizing agent. In one or more embodiments, the oxidizing agent can comprise any oxidizing agent known to one of skill in the art.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At operation <b>218</b>, the processing chamber is optionally purged after exposure to the chalcogenide reactant. Purging the processing chamber in operation <b>218</b> can be the same process or different process than the purge in operation <b>214</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At decision <b>220</b>, the thickness of the deposited film, or number of cycles of precursor and reactant is considered.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one or more embodiments, the deposited film is substantially free of oxygen.

Accordingly, without intending to be bound by theory, it is thought that the transition metal dichalcogenide film that is formed is formed without producing oxygen as a byproduct, thus minimizing the potential to etch/corrode underlying metal layers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The optional post-processing operation <b>230</b> can be, for example, a process to modify film properties (e.g., annealing) or a further film deposition process (e.g., additional ALD or CVD processes) to grow additional films. In some embodiments, the optional post-processing operation <b>230</b> can be a process that modifies a property of the deposited film. In some embodiments, the optional post-processing operation <b>230</b> comprises annealing the as-deposited film. In some embodiments, annealing is done at temperatures in the range of about 300&#xb0; C., 400&#xb0; C., 500&#xb0; C., 600&#xb0; C., 700&#xb0; C., 800&#xb0; C., 900&#xb0; C., or 1000&#xb0; C. The annealing environment of some embodiments comprises one or more of an inert gas (e.g., molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), argon (Ar)) or a reducing gas (e.g., molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) or ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)) or an oxidant, such as, but not limited to, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), or peroxides. Annealing can be performed for any suitable length of time. In some embodiments, the film is annealed for a predetermined time in the range of about 15 seconds to about 90 minutes, or in the range of about 1 minute to about 60 minutes. In some embodiments, annealing the as-deposited film increases the density, decreases the resistivity and/or increases the purity of the film and/or increases the crystallinity of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method <b>200</b> can be performed at any suitable temperature depending on, for example, the transition metal precursor, transition metal oxide precursor, chalcogenide reactant, oxide reactant or thermal budget of the device.

In some embodiments, exposure to the transition metal precursor or the transition metal oxide precursor (operation <b>212</b>) and the chalcogenide reactant or the oxide reactant (operation <b>216</b>) occur at the same temperature. In some embodiments, the substrate is maintained at a temperature in a range of from 350&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, exposure to the transition metal precursor or the transition metal oxide precursor (operation <b>212</b>) occurs at a different temperature than the exposure to the chalcogenide reactant or the oxide reactant (operation <b>216</b>). In some embodiments, the substrate is maintained at a first temperature in a range of from 350&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., for the exposure to the transition metal precursor or the transition metal oxide precursor, and at a second temperature in the range of from 350&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., for exposure the chalcogenide reactant or the oxide reactant. In some embodiments, both the metal and chalcogen/oxidant precursors are delivered at the same substrate temperature. The adsorbed metal precursor alone on the substrate may be self-limiting and, in some embodiments, multiple pulses of the metal precursor shall not provide a multilayer film without the chalcogen/oxidant. In some embodiments, both the precursors make a complete cycle which are carried out at the same substrate temperatures.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods of depositing transition metal dichalcogenide films in high aspect ratio features. A high aspect ratio feature is a trench, via or pillar having a height:width ratio greater than or equal to about 10, 20, or 50, or more. In some embodiments, the transition metal-containing film is deposited conformally on the high aspect ratio feature. As used in this manner, a conformal film has a thickness near the top of the feature that is in the range of about 80-120% of the thickness at the bottom of the feature.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Some embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods for bottom-up gapfill of a feature. A bottom-up gapfill process fills the feature from the bottom versus a conformal process which fills the feature from the bottom and sides. In some embodiments, the feature has a first material at the bottom (e.g., a nitride) and a second material (e.g., an oxide) at the sidewalls. The transition metal dichalcogenide film deposits selectively on the first material relative to the second material so that the transition metal dichalcogenide film fills the feature in a bottom-up manner.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to one or more embodiments, the substrate is subjected to processing prior to and/or after forming the layer. This processing can be performed in the same chamber or in one or more separate processing chambers. In some embodiments, the substrate is moved from the first chamber to a separate, second chamber for further processing. The substrate can be moved directly from the first chamber to the separate processing chamber, or it can be moved from the first chamber to one or more transfer chambers, and then moved to the separate processing chamber. Accordingly, the processing apparatus may comprise multiple chambers in communication with a transfer station. An apparatus of this sort may be referred to as a &#x201c;cluster tool&#x201d; or &#x201c;clustered system,&#x201d; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Generally, a cluster tool is a modular system comprising multiple chambers which perform various functions including substrate center-finding and orientation, degassing, annealing, deposition and/or etching. According to one or more embodiments, a cluster tool includes at least a first chamber and a central transfer chamber. The central transfer chamber may house a robot that can shuttle substrates between and among processing chambers and load lock chambers. The transfer chamber is typically maintained at a vacuum condition and provides an intermediate stage for shuttling substrates from one chamber to another and/or to a load lock chamber positioned at a front end of the cluster tool. Two well-known cluster tools which may be adapted for the present disclosure are the Centura&#xae; and the Endura&#xae;, both available from Applied Materials, Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif. However, the exact arrangement and combination of chambers may be altered for purposes of performing specific steps of a process as described herein. Other processing chambers which may be used include, but are not limited to, cyclical layer deposition (CLD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), etch, pre-clean, chemical clean, thermal treatment such as RTP, plasma nitridation, degas, orientation, hydroxylation, and other substrate processes. By carrying out processes in a chamber on a cluster tool, surface contamination of the substrate with atmospheric impurities can be avoided without oxidation prior to depositing a subsequent film.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to one or more embodiments, the substrate is continuously under vacuum or &#x201c;load lock&#x201d; conditions and is not exposed to ambient air when being moved from one chamber to the next. The transfer chambers are thus under vacuum and are &#x201c;pumped down&#x201d; under vacuum pressure. Inert gases may be present in the processing chambers or the transfer chambers. In some embodiments, an inert gas is used as a purge gas to remove some or all of the reactants (e.g., reactant). According to one or more embodiments, a purge gas is injected at the exit of the deposition chamber to prevent reactants (e.g., reactant) from moving from the deposition chamber to the transfer chamber and/or additional processing chamber. Thus, the flow of inert gas forms a curtain at the exit of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The substrate can be processed in single substrate deposition chambers, where a single substrate is loaded, processed, and unloaded before another substrate is processed. The substrate can also be processed in a continuous manner, similar to a conveyer system, in which multiple substrates are individually loaded into a first part of the chamber, move through the chamber, and are unloaded from a second part of the chamber. The shape of the chamber and associated conveyer system can form a straight path or curved path. Additionally, the processing chamber may be a carousel in which multiple substrates are moved about a central axis and are exposed to deposition, etch, annealing, cleaning, etc. processes throughout the carousel path.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">During processing, the substrate can be heated or cooled. Such heating or cooling can be accomplished by any suitable means including, but not limited to, changing the temperature of the substrate support, and flowing heated or cooled gases to the substrate surface. In some embodiments, the substrate support includes a heater/cooler which can be controlled to change the substrate temperature conductively. In one or more embodiments, the gases (either reactive gases or inert gases) being employed are heated or cooled to locally change the substrate temperature. In some embodiments, a heater/cooler is positioned within the chamber adjacent the substrate surface to convectively change the substrate temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The substrate can also be stationary or rotated during processing. A rotating substrate can be rotated (about the substrate axis) continuously or in discrete steps. For example, a substrate may be rotated throughout the entire process, or the substrate can be rotated by a small amount between exposures to different reactive or purge gases. Rotating the substrate during processing (either continuously or in steps) may help produce a more uniform deposition or etch by minimizing the effect of, for example, local variability in gas flow geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.
