<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-102903 filed on Jun. 22, 2021, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present specification discloses a manufacturing method of a porous silicon material, a porous silicon material, and a power storage device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, as a negative electrode material of silicon, porous silicon has been suggested which is obtained by mixing 70 parts by mass of Si lumps with 30 parts by mass of Al powder, then making the mixture into a molten alloy in an argon atmosphere, making the alloy into particles by a gas atomization method using a helium gas, and then removing Al by using hydrochloric acid (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-214054 (JP 2004-214054 A)). According to JP 2004-214054 A, the porous silicon makes it possible to completely suppress micronization resulting from the volumetric expansion and contraction of an active material during charge and discharge, peeling of the active material from a current collector, and lack of contact with a conductive material. As a manufacturing method of a silicon material, a method has been suggested which includes separating a Si alloy composed of Si and an intermediate alloy element including Mg, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, or the like into Si fine particles and a second phase formed by the substitution of the intermediate alloy element with a molten element in a molten metal containing a predetermined molten element and removing the second phase to obtain a porous silicon material (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-82125 (JP 2012-82125 A)). According to JP 2012-82125 A, with the porous silicon material, a high capacity and high cycle characteristics can be obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, using an alloy having a Si content of 50% by mass or more, the manufacturing method in JP 2004-214054 A is not effective enough to reduce the problem resulting from the expansion and contraction of Si. In the manufacturing method of a porous silicon material in JP 2012-82125 A, the silicon alloy containing the intermediate alloy element needs to be melted and substituted in a molten metal containing a predetermined molten element, that is, the silicon alloy needs to be treated at a high temperature, which necessitates a simple manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure has been made in consideration of the above problems, and the main object of the present disclosure is to provide a manufacturing method of a porous silicon material that can further improve electrochemical characteristics, a porous silicon material, and a power storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result of carrying out intensive studies to achieve the aforementioned object, the inventors of the present disclosure have found that preparing a silicon alloy containing Al at a mixing ratio close to that in a eutectic composition, removing Al, and performing a heating treatment enables Al present as a solid solution in silicon to diffuse to the surface of the alloy, which makes it possible to obtain a porous silicon material that can further improve electrochemical characteristics. Based on the finding, the inventors have accomplished the manufacturing method of a porous silicon material, the porous silicon material, and the power storage device of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">That is, the manufacturing method of a porous silicon material of the present disclosure includes a particle forming step of making a silicon alloy that contains Al as a first element in an amount of 50% by mass or more and Si in an amount of 50% by mass or less into particles, a pore forming step of removing the first element from the silicon alloy to obtain a porous material, and a heat treatment step of heating the porous material to diffuse elements other than Si to a surface of the porous material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The porous silicon material of the present disclosure contains skeletal silicon with a three-dimensional network structure having voids that is formed of silicon having a lattice constant of 5.435 &#x212b; or less, in which an average porosity of the porous silicon material is in a range of 50% by volume or more and 95% by volume or less, a proportion of Si contained in the porous silicon material as an element excluding oxygen is 85% by mass or more, a proportion of Al contained in the porous silicon material as a first element is in a range of 15% by mass or less, and Al is present on a surface of the porous silicon material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The power storage device of the present disclosure includes a positive electrode that contains a positive electrode active material, a negative electrode that contains the aforementioned porous silicon material as a negative electrode active material, and an ion conducting medium that is interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode and conducts carrier ions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure can further improve the electrochemical characteristics of materials containing Si. The reason why such an effect is obtained is presumed as follows. For example, in a lithium ion secondary battery, a silicon electrode has a theoretical capacity of 4,199 mAh/g, which is about 10 times higher than theoretical capacity, 372 mAh/g, of general graphite. Therefore, the silicon electrode is expected to further increase capacity and energy density. Meanwhile, silicon having absorbed lithium ions is Li<sub>4.4</sub>Si, which has a volume having expanded about 4 times the volume of silicon not yet absorbing lithium. According to the present disclosure, a substance other than silicon that is mainly Al and incorporated into a silicon alloy is selectively removed by being dissolved, which makes it possible to easily produce a porous silicon material having a small pore size and a high porosity. When the porous silicon material having a small pore size and a high porosity is used in a power storage device, such as a lithium ion secondary battery, the expansion and contraction of volume are significantly mitigated. Accordingly, for example, charge and discharge characteristics, such as charge and discharge cycle characteristics, can be improved, which makes it possible to easily obtain a high-performance power storage device. In the porous silicon material, other elements, such as Al, are diffused on the surface. Therefore, the porous silicon material has a purer silicon skeleton, which can further improve electrochemical characteristics, such as charge and discharge capacities.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Manufacturing Method of Porous Silicon Material</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The manufacturing method of a porous silicon material of the present disclosure includes a particle forming step, a pore forming step, and a heat treatment step. In the particle forming step, a treatment of making a silicon alloy containing Al as a first element and Si into particles is performed. In the pore forming step, a treatment of removing the first element from the silicon alloy to obtain a porous material is performed. In the heat treatment step, a treatment of heating the porous material to diffuse elements other than Si to a surface of the porous material is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Particle Forming Step</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the particle forming step, a silicon alloy is used in which the content of the first element is in a range of 50% by mass or more and the content of Si is in a range of 50% by mass or less. Examples of the first element include Al. Examples of raw materials used in the particle forming step include a Si metal and an Al metal. The content of the first element in the silicon alloy used in the particle forming step is, in embodiments, in a range of 60% by mass or more and, in some embodiments, in a range of 70% by mass or more, or may be in a range of 80% by mass or more. The content of the first element in the silicon alloy used in the particle forming step is, in embodiments, in a range of 92% by mass or less and, in some embodiments, in a range of 90% by mass or less, or may be in a range of 85% by mass or less. The silicon alloy in which the content of the first element is in the range may be used in embodiments because the silicon alloy can further increase porosity and makes it possible to obtain voids having more suitable shape and size. In a case where the content of the first element is 92% by mass or less, the silicon skeleton can be maintained. In a case where the content of the first element is 50% by mass or more, the porosity can be further increased. In a case where the content of Al is high, a single phase of Al is precipitated much after the silicon alloy is made into an alloy by melting and then rapidly cooled. Accordingly, many voids can be formed. In the particle forming step, a silicon alloy in which the content of the first element is in a range capable of forming a eutectic composition may be used. The eutectic composition contains 87.6% by mass of Al and 12.6% by mass of Si. However, the silicon alloy may be close to the eutectic composition, or may cover a predetermined range, such as a part of a hypoeutectic or hypereutectic composition. For example, the silicon alloy may be in a range of &#xb1;3% by mass with respect to the eutectic composition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an equilibrium phase diagram of an Al&#x2014;Si binary system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the particle forming step, the silicon alloy may be a composition that contains, in addition to the first element and Si, a second element including one or more elements among Ca, Cu, Mg, Na, Sr, and P. Among these, one or more elements among Ca, Na, and Sr may be the second element, in embodiments. The content of the second element is lower than the content of the first element. For example, in the silicon alloy, the content of the second element with respect to the total mass of the silicon alloy is, in embodiments, in a range of 10% by mass or less, and, in embodiments, in a range of 5% by mass or less. The content of the second element may be 0.1% by mass or more.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the particle forming step, the raw materials may contain unavoidable impurities. The unavoidable impurities are components that inevitably remain in the process of purifying any of Si, Ti, and Al. Examples of the unavoidable impurities include Fe, C, Cu, Ni, and P. In embodiments, the content of the unavoidable impurities may be lower. For example, on the assumption that the total amount of Si and Al is 100 at %, the content of the unavoidable impurities is 5 at % or less, in embodiments, and 2 at % or less, in some embodiments. The raw materials used in the particle forming step may be composed of Si in a predetermined range and Al plus unavoidable impurities as a remainder. The content of Si in a predetermined range may, for example, be in a range of 10 at % or more and 28 at % or less.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The particle forming step may be a step of making the molten silicon alloy into particles by any of a gas atomization method, a water atomization method, and a roll quenching method. The particle forming step may also be a step of casting the molten raw material of the silicon alloy into a mold and crushing the obtained ingot to form particles. Among the above methods, the gas atomization method may be used in embodiments as a method for making the silicon alloy into particles. During gas atomization, the alloy may be melted in an Ar atmosphere, and particles may be formed in an Ar or He atmosphere. In the particle forming step, the silicon alloy may be made into particles having an average particle size in a range of 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more and 100 &#x3bc;m or less. The average particle size of the particles is, for example, 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 10 &#x3bc;m or less, in embodiments, 1 &#x3bc;m or more and 5 &#x3bc;m or less, and, in embodiments, 1 &#x3bc;m or more and 3 &#x3bc;m or less. The silicon alloy particles may be appropriately selected depending on the characteristics that the power storage device needs to have. The average particle size of the particles is determined by observing the particles with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), adding up the major diameters of the particles as diameters of the particles, and dividing the result by the number of particles, so that the average particle size is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Pore Forming Step</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the pore forming step, a treatment of removing substances other than Si from the silicon alloy prepared in the particle forming step is performed. Examples of the substances other than Si include Al as the first element or an Al compound and the second element or a compound of the second element. In the pore forming step, an acid or alkali may be used to selectively remove Al as the first element or an Al compound or remove the second element or a compound of the second element. The acid or alkali to be used may be a substance that elutes elements and/or compounds other than silicon in the silicon alloy but does not elute silicon. Examples of the acid or alkali include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and sodium hydroxide. The acid or alkali may be an aqueous solution, in embodiments. The concentration of the acid or alkali is not particularly limited as long as Al as the first element or an Al compound and the second element or a compound of the second element can be removed. For example, the concentration of the acid or alkali can be in a range of 1 mol/L or more and 5 mol/L or less. The removal treatment may be performed by heating at, for example, 20&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. In the removal treatment, the silicon alloy particles may be immersed in an acid or alkali solution and the solution may be stirred for about 1 hour to 5 hours. The obtained porous silicon material is then washed and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the pore forming step, the amount of substances other than Si to be removed may be in a range of 85% by mass or more and 100% by mass or less. For example, it does not matter even though the first or second element and oxygen other than the first and second elements may remain. However, because these are components unnecessary for the porous silicon material, the amount of these be smaller, in embodiments. The pore forming step may also be a step of obtaining a porous silicon material having an average porosity in a range of 50% by volume or more and 95% by volume or less. The average porosity is a value measured by a mercury porosimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Heat Treatment Step</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the heat treatment step, a treatment of heating the porous material obtained by the pore forming step to diffuse elements other than Si to the surface of the porous material is performed. In the heat treatment step, the porous material may be heated at a temperature in a range of 400&#xb0; C. or higher and 1,100&#xb0; C. or lower. In this temperature range, at a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. or higher, Al that is present as a solid solution in the silicon skeleton is precipitated. Presumably, at a temperature of 600&#xb0; C. or higher, the precipitated Al may diffuse on the surface. In addition, presumably, at a temperature of 800&#xb0; C. or higher, Al having diffused on the surface of the silicon skeleton may form an oxide and strengthen the silicon skeleton. In embodiments, in the heat treatment step, the first element having diffused on the surface may be oxidized and the surface of the silicon skeleton may be coated with the oxide containing the first element. Coating with the oxide makes it possible to further strengthen the silicon skeleton. The oxide may include an AlSi oxide, an AlFe oxide, a SiFe oxide, an AlSiFe oxide, and the like, in addition to an Al oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the heat treatment step, the porous material may be heated in a temperature range of 600&#xb0; C. or higher in an inert atmosphere. In a case where the porous material is heated under this condition, Al is precipitated and diffuses on the surface. At the time, the porous material may be heated in a temperature range of 800&#xb0; C. or higher in an inert atmosphere. In a case where the porous material is heated under this condition, the surface of the silicon skeleton can be coated with an oxide containing Al. Examples of the inert atmosphere include a nitrogen atmosphere and a noble gas atmosphere. The inert atmosphere is a noble gas atmosphere, in embodiments. Examples of the noble gas include He and Ar. In embodiments, the noble gas may comprise Ar. Alternatively, in the heat treatment step, the porous material may be heated in the presence of oxygen at a temperature in a range of 400&#xb0; C. or higher. In a case where the porous material is heated under this condition, Al can be precipitated, and an oxide can be produced. &#x201c;In the presence of oxygen&#x201d; means mild conditions that do not induce overoxidation of the silicon skeleton. For example, the oxygen content in such conditions may be in a range of 5% by volume or less or 1% by volume or less, or may be 1,000 ppm or less or 100 ppm or less. The heat treatment in the presence of oxygen is, in embodiments, performed at a lower temperature compared to the heat treatment in the inert atmosphere. The temperature is, in embodiments 900&#xb0; C. or lower and, in embodiments, 700&#xb0; C. or lower, or may be 600&#xb0; C. or lower.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Electrode for Power Storage Device</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The electrode for the power storage device of the present disclosure includes the aforementioned porous silicon material as an electrode active material. The electrode can be either a positive electrode or a negative electrode based on the potential opposite to the potential of the active material. When lithium is used as a carrier, the electrode is, in embodiments, a negative electrode. The electrode can be used, for example, in a lithium ion secondary battery, a hybrid capacitor, and an air battery. The electrode for the power storage device may be an electrode compressed, so that the average porosity of the porous silicon material falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less. The electrode may be compressed when prepared, so that the porosity of the porous silicon material is reduced. Compared to the porous silicon material prepared as a material having a porosity in a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less, a porous silicon material that is prepared as a material having a porosity of 50% by volume or more and 95% or less and then compressed, so that the porosity falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less exhibits better charge and discharge characteristics due to the shape of voids and the like. For example, when porous silicon particles are used as a negative electrode active material of a lithium ion secondary battery, the smaller the pores, the more uniform the obtained alloy when lithium ions take part in alloying. Therefore, stress concentration is reduced, which makes it possible to prevent the deterioration of the electrode. The average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be appropriately adjusted depending on the characteristics that the electrode for the power storage device needs to have. For example, the average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be 10% by volume or more or 20% by volume or more. The average porosity of the compressed porous silicon material may be, for example, 40% by volume or less or 30% by volume or less.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The electrode for the power storage device may be an electrode including a current collector and the aforementioned porous silicon material that is formed and fixed on the current collector. The electrode can be prepared by a step of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder and a solvent as needed and making the mixture into a paste or a step of mixing the porous silicon material with a conductive material or a binder as needed and bonding the mixture to a current collector under pressure. In embodiments, the content of the porous silicon material in the electrode may be higher. The content of the porous silicon material in the electrode is, in embodiments, 70% by mass or more, in embodiments, 80% by mass or more, and, in embodiments, 85% by mass or more. The conductive material is not particularly limited as long as it is an electron conducting material that does not adversely affect the battery performance. For example, among graphite such as natural graphite (flaky graphite or scale-like graphite) or artificial graphite, acetylene black, carbon black, Ketjen black, carbon whisker, needle cokes, carbon fiber, and a metal (such as copper, nickel, aluminum, silver, or gold), one kind of material or a mixture of two or more kinds of these materials can be used. The binder is a material that functions to bind active material particles and conductive material particles together. For example, among a fluorine-containing resin, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), or fluororubber, a thermoplastic resin, such as polypropylene or polyethylene, ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM), sulfonated EPDM rubber, and natural butyl rubber (NBR), one kind of material or a mixture of two or more kinds of these materials can be used. It is also possible to use a cellulose-based binder that is an aqueous binder, an aqueous dispersion of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and the like. As the solvent, for example, an organic solvent, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, methylethylketone, cyclohexanone, methyl acetate, methyl acrylate, diethylenetriamine, N,N-dimethylaminopropylamine, ethylene oxide, or tetrahydrofuran, can be used. A dispersant, a thickener, or the like may be added to water, and the active material may be made into a slurry by using a latex, such as SBR. Examples of coating methods include roller coating with an applicator roll, screen coating, a doctor blade method, spin coating, and bar coating. Any of these can be used to obtain any thickness and shape. The current collector may be appropriately selected depending on the potential of the active material. For example, in addition to aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, nickel, iron, copper, calcined carbon, a conductive polymer, and conductive glass, for the purpose of improving adhesiveness, conductivity, and oxidation resistance, a current collector prepared by treating the surface of aluminum or copper with carbon, nickel, titanium, or silver can be used. The surface can be oxidized as well. The current collector may be in the form of, for example, a foil, film, sheet, net, punched or expanded material, lath, porous material, foamed material, or material formed of a fiber assembly. The thickness of the current collector to be used is, for example, 1 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m. The amount of active material complex to be formed may be appropriately set depending on the desired performance that the power storage device needs to demonstrate.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Manufacturing Method of Electrode for Power Storage Device</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The manufacturing method of an electrode for a power storage device includes a pressing step of compressing a porous silicon material obtained by the aforementioned manufacturing method of a porous silicon material as an electrode active material, so that the average porosity of the porous silicon material falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less. The pressing step makes it possible to reduce porosity while maintaining a suitable pore shape and to further increase energy density. In the pressing step, the porous silicon material may be compressed, so that the average porosity thereof falls into a range of 10% by volume or more or 20% by volume or more, and a range of 40% by volume or less or 30% by volume or less.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Manufacturing Method of All-Solid-State Lithium-Ion Secondary Battery</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The manufacturing method of an all-solid-state lithium-ion secondary battery includes a laminate preparation step of preparing a laminate composed of a positive electrode, a solid electrolyte conducting lithium ions, and a negative electrode laminated on each other, by using an electrode for a power storage device obtained by the aforementioned manufacturing method of an electrode for a power storage device as a negative electrode.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As being specifically described above, the present disclosure can further improve the electrochemical characteristics of materials containing Si. The reason why such an effect is obtained is presumed as follows. For example, in a lithium ion secondary battery, a silicon electrode has a theoretical capacity of 4,199 mAh/g, which is about 10 times higher than theoretical capacity, 372 mAh/g, of general graphite. Therefore, the silicon electrode is expected to further increase capacity and energy density. Meanwhile, silicon having absorbed lithium ions is Li<sub>4.4</sub>Si, which has a volume having expanded about 4 times the volume of silicon not yet absorbing lithium. According to the present disclosure, a substance other than silicon that is mainly Al and incorporated into a silicon alloy is selectively removed by being dissolved, which makes it possible to easily produce a porous silicon material having a small pore size and a high porosity. When the porous silicon material having a small pore size and a high porosity is used in a power storage device, such as a lithium ion secondary battery, the expansion and contraction of volume are significantly mitigated. Accordingly, for example, charge and discharge characteristics, such as charge and discharge cycle characteristics, can be improved, which makes it possible to easily obtain a high-performance power storage device. In the porous silicon material, other elements, such as Al, are diffused on the surface. Therefore, the porous silicon material has a purer silicon skeleton, which can further improve electrochemical characteristics, such as charge and discharge capacities.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Results of Physical Property Measurement and Review</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an SEM image of the Al&#x2014;Si alloy observed after gas atomization in Experimental Example 1. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a structure was confirmed in which eutectic Si exists between large primary Al. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D</figref> are SEM images and an EDAX mapping images of the porous silicon material of Experimental Example 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a full image, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref> are enlarged images, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is an EDAX image. In Experimental Example 1, it was confirmed that Si takes up 13% by mass in the raw material composition and is a structure containing skeletal silicon that maintains a particle shape and has a three-dimensional network structure having voids on the inside of the particle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. From the EDAX image, it was revealed that the structure is composed of Si, although extremely small amounts of Al and O were detected. It was confirmed that most of the primary Al is removed by the pore forming step as an acid treatment at room temperature. The Al concentration determined by ICP-OES after the pore forming treatment was 4.2% by mass. From the result, it was considered that the composition of the raw material powder tells that most of the aluminum is eluted and porous silicon is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a pore distribution curve of the porous silicon material of Experimental Example 1. In mercury porosimeter, sometimes the holes between particles are included in the measurement result. Therefore, the alloy particles not yet being subjected to the pore forming treatment and the porous silicon material obtained after the pore forming treatment were measured, and the difference therebetween was adopted as a pore volume. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the difference is represented by a shaded portion. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the pore size is 1 &#x3bc;m or less, which is consistent with the size of voids confirmed by the SEM image. As a result of measurement with the mercury porosimeter, it was confirmed that the porous silicon material of Experimental Example 1 has a pore distribution of 50 nm to 500 nm in which a pore size of around 200 nm takes up the highest proportion, and has a porosity of 76% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The composition ratio of raw materials (% by mass), the amount of residual Al after acid treatment (% by mass), and the porosity (% by volume) of Experimental Examples 1 to 7 are summarized in Table 1. The amount of Al is a measurement result obtained by ICP-OES, and the porosity is a value excluding holes between particles. As shown in Table 1, it was found that the amount of residual Al after the acid treatment in Experimental Examples 1 to 7 is 3.2% to 6.2% by mass, and most of Al is eluted by the pore forming treatment which is an acid treatment. While the porosity of Experimental Examples 1 to 5 was 62% to 86% by volume, the porosity of Experimental Example 6 was 33% by volume which is a low porosity.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0084">Preparation of Lithium Secondary Battery Using a Non-Aqueous Electrolytic Solution</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">Each of the silicon materials (82% by mass) of Experimental Examples 1 to 7 as a negative electrode active material, 6% by mass of acetylene black having an average particle size of 2 &#x3bc;m as a conductive material, and 12% by mass of polyimide as a binder were weighed, mixed together, mixed with N-methylpyrrolidone, and then stirred, thereby preparing a slurry as a negative electrode mixture. The slurry was then applied to a copper foil having a thickness of 12 &#x3bc;m, dried, and rolled, thereby preparing a negative electrode having a thickness of 50 &#x3bc;m. It was assumed that the rolling might reduce the porosity of the porous silicon material to about 50% by volume while allowing the porous silicon material to maintain the three-dimensional network structure. The prepared negative electrode was punched into circles having a diameter of 16 mm, a porous polyethylene separator was interposed between the negative electrodes, and metallic lithium was stacked thereon as a counter electrode, thereby forming a laminate. Subsequently, an electrolytic solution obtained by adding LiPF<sub>6 </sub>at a concentration of 1 mol/L to a mixed solvent obtained by mixing together ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) at a volume ratio of 3:4:3 was injected into the aforementioned laminate, thereby manufacturing a lithium secondary battery which is a Tomcell-type small battery cell. The obtained lithium secondary battery was repeatedly charged and discharged 10 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C and a battery voltage in a range of 0 V to 1.5 V.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0086">Characteristics of Lithium Secondary Battery Using Non-Aqueous Electrolytic Solution</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0087">The initial discharge capacity (mAh/g) of Experimental Examples 1 to 7, the discharge capacity (mAh/g) of the same examples after 10 cycles, and the capacity retention rate (%) of the same examples are summarized in Table 2. The capacity retention rate was calculated from Formula Q<sub>10</sub>/Q<sub>1</sub>&#xd7;100 where Q<sub>1 </sub>represents a discharge capacity in the first cycle and Q<sub>10 </sub>represents the discharge capacity in the tenth cycle. As shown in Table 2, the capacity retention rate in Experimental Example 7 was 26% that is a low rate, which leaded to the assumption that silicon particles having no voids could not absorb the volume change and might cause problems in the electrode. Even in Experimental Example 6 having a porosity of 33% by volume that is a low porosity, the capacity retention rate was less than 70%, which tells that the capacity retention rate is insufficient. On the other hand, the lithium secondary batteries of Experimental Examples 1 to 5 had a capacity retention rate of 84% to 93% that is an excellent value, which tells that the electrodes are stable. In this way, as shown in Experimental Examples 1 to 5, it was revealed that in a case where a porous silicon material having a porosity of 60% by volume or more is compressed and thus the porosity falls into a range of 5% by volume or more and 50% by volume or less, the capacity retention rate can be particularly increased.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0089">Al lumps (88% by mass) having sides of 10 mm and 12% by mass of Si lumps were weighed, mixed together, and dissolved in an Ar inert atmosphere by a high-frequency heating method, thereby obtaining a molten alloy. The molten alloy was subjected to gas atomization using an Ar inert gas, thereby obtaining AlSi alloy powder having an average particle size of 8 &#x3bc;m (particle forming step). The composition of the atomized powder can be represented by Al-12.4% by mass of Si-0.14% by mass of Fe, and the structure thereof was composed of primary Al and eutectic Si. Next, the obtained alloy powder was added to 3 mol/L hydrochloric acid diluted with pure water, stirred at room temperature of 25&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, then filtered while being thoroughly washed, and dried in a vacuum drier at 30&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. (pore forming step). A treatment for eluting the primary Al was performed, thereby obtaining a porous material (porous silicon particles as a precursor). The obtained porous material was subjected to a heat treatment in an Ar atmosphere under the conditions of 1,000&#xb0; C. and 2 hours (heat treatment step), and the obtained strengthened porous silicon powder was used as a porous silicon material of Experimental Example 8. In the heat treatment step, Al present as a solid solution in eutectic Si forming the skeleton can be diffused and removed to the surface of the porous material, and an oxide contributing to the strengthening of the skeleton can be formed.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0095">The porous silicon powder having undergone the acid treatment was dissolved by HF and HNO<sub>3</sub>, and the amount of Al in porous silicon was measured by ICP optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, PS3520U VDDIIII manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Science Corporation.). In addition, elemental analysis was performed by observation with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4300 manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Science Corporation.) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX, S-4300 manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Science Corporation.). The pore distribution was measured with a mercury porosimeter (POWERMASTER60GT manufactured by Quantachrome Instruments).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0096">Results and Review</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0097">Table 3 shows the raw material composition (at %) of Experimental Examples 8 to 12, the porosity (% by volume) of silicon materials after the pore forming treatment (acid treatment) and the heat treatment at 1,000&#xb0; C., the amount (% by mass) of Al solid solution after the acid treatment (before the heat treatment), the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>(&#x212b;) after the acid treatment, and the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>(&#x212b;) after the pore forming treatment and the heat treatment. The porosity is represented by a value determined by the mercury intrusion porosimeter. The amount of Al solid solution is represented by a value determined by ICP analysis. As shown in Table 3, the porous silicon materials having undergone the heat treatment in Experimental Examples 8 to 11 have a porosity or of 50% by volume or more and may have a porosity of 60% by volume or more, which tells that porous silicon materials could be formed. It was assumed that the amount of residual Al in the porous silicon materials may be in a range of 3% to 5% by mass. As for the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>of Si having undergone the acid treatment and not yet being subjected to the heat treatment, while Si in Experimental Example 12 has a<sub>Si </sub>of 5.430 (&#x212b;), Si in Experimental Examples 8 to 11 has a<sub>Si </sub>of 5.440 (&#x212b;) or more, which tells that Al is present as a solid solution in Si. As for the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>of Si having undergone the acid treatment and the heat treatment, Si in Experimental Examples 8 to 11 has a<sub>Si </sub>of 5.435 (&#x212b;) or less which is the same as a<sub>Si </sub>of Si in Experimental Example 12. From the result, it was assumed that in Experimental Examples 8 to 11, by the heat treatment at 1,000&#xb0; C., Al present as a solid solution in Si might diffuse to the surface side, which might lead to the transition to a silicon skeleton in which no Al solid solution is present.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, by the elution of primary Al in the silicon compound with an acid, pores were formed, and porous silicon particles were obtained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a pore distribution curve of the porous silicon material of Experimental Example 8. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, after being subjected to the heating treatment at 1,000&#xb0; C., the porous silicon material had a pore distribution of several tens of nanometers to 11 &#x3bc;m where the peak of pore size was 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0099">Next, the change in crystal structure of the porous silicon material caused by the heat treatment temperature was investigated by X-ray diffraction. As a heat treatment, raw materials having the composition of Experimental Example 8 were heated from 100&#xb0; C. to 1,000&#xb0; C. by 100&#xb0; C. in an Ar atmosphere, and the obtained porous silicon material was analyzed by XRD. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram showing the relationship between heat treatment temperatures and XRD profiles in Experimental Example 8. From the measurement result of the XRD profiles, the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>of Si was calculated by Rietveld analysis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram showing the relationship between heat treatment temperatures and a lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>in Experimental Example 8. From the X-ray diffraction pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a broad peak derived from amorphous phase was observed at around 2&#x3b8;=20&#xb0; to 25&#xb0;. The amorphous phase is derived from SiO<sub>2</sub>. SiO<sub>2 </sub>is present in the porous silicon material before the heat treatment. SiO<sub>2 </sub>has approximately doubled in terms of molar ratio after the heat treatment at a temperature of 600&#xb0; C. or higher. A peak of Al was detected in a temperature range of the heat treatment temperature of 400&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C. In the atomized powder, the content of Fe impurities was about 0.1% by mass. Therefore, at a temperature of 700&#xb0; C. or higher, a peak of FeSi<sub>2 </sub>was detected, which tells that FeSi<sub>2 </sub>was generated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, from the change in the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>of Si caused by the heat treatment temperature, it was assumed that the lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>of Si not yet being subjected to the heat treatment might have a larger lattice constant a<sub>Si </sub>compared to a pure Si standard sample and might contain Al as a solid solution. By the heat treatment, the lattice constant began to decrease at 300&#xb0; C., and became substantially equal to the lattice constant of pure Si at 400&#xb0; C. From the result, it was assumed that Al present as a solid solution in the porous material might be precipitated at a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. or higher, Al present as a solid solution in Si might diffuse to the surface thereof and be removed from the inside of the silicon skeleton.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0100">Next, the amount of Al present on the surface of the porous silicon material having undergone a heat treatment in a temperature range of 100&#xb0; C. to 1,000&#xb0; C. was measured. In this way, whether the amount of Al solid solution in the silicon skeleton in the porous silicon material is reduced after the heat treatment was investigated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram showing the relationship between heat treatment temperatures and amounts of Al dissolved (% by mass) in Experimental Example 8. The amount of Al present on the surface was measured as follows. First, the porous material having the composition of Experimental Example 8 was subjected to a heat treatment at each temperature, and 10 mL of 6 mol/L nitric acid and 5 mL of 50% by volume hydrofluoric acid were added to each of the obtained porous silicon materials and dissolved by heating. Then, 10 mL of 8 mol/L sulfuric acid was added thereto, the mixture was further heated to generate white smoke of sulfuric acid, and then the mixture was diluted to 100 mL. In the acid treatment for ICP analysis, Si, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the like are not dissolved, and Al metal is dissolved. By using the solution, the amount of Al was quantified by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the ordinate shows the amount of Al dissolved (% by mass) with respect to the total amount of the porous silicon material including Si and Al, the dashed line shows the amount of Al as a solid solution (4.1% by mass) in the porous silicon material not yet being subjected to the heat treatment, and the dotted line is a line corresponding to 90% by mass (3.7% by mass) of the amount represented by the dashed line. Al present as a solid solution in the porous silicon material began to be precipitated on the surface of the silicon skeleton by the heat treatment at a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. or higher, then kept increasing until the temperature reached 700&#xb0; C., and decreased again when the temperature was 800&#xb0; C. or higher. It was revealed that in a case where the heat treatment is performed in an Ar atmosphere in a range of 400&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C., Al present as a solid solution in the silicon skeleton is removed from the inside of the silicon skeleton and diffuses to the surface of the silicon skeleton, and particularly in a range of 600&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C., Al as a solid solution can be reduced by about 90%. It is expected that at a temperature of 800&#xb0; C. or higher, even in an Ar atmosphere, the Al metal may be oxidized, and Al oxide may be formed on the surface of the silicon skeleton. It was assumed that accordingly, the Al metal might not be dissolved by the acid treatment for ICP analysis, and the amount of Al dissolved might be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0101">From the result, it was revealed that performing a heat treatment at a temperature of 600&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C. and then performing an acid treatment on the porous silicon material makes it possible to reduce the amount of Al in Si while maintaining the microstructure that can suppress volume expansion. To sum up the results of the crystal structure change investigated by X-ray diffraction, it was assumed that the state of Al in the porous silicon material might change as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A to <b>11</b>D</figref> due to the heat treatment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A to <b>11</b>D</figref> are views illustrating how the state of the porous silicon material changes by each treatment. In a case where an acid treatment is performed on the AlSi alloy powder obtained by the atomization treatment, solely the primary Al is eluted, and the residual eutectic Si forms a skeleton and turns into a porous material (Si) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). In a quenching atomization treatment, Al contained in the eutectic Si is in a state of solid solution. In a case where Al present as a solid solution in Si is subjected to a heating treatment at a temperature of 300&#xb0; C. or higher, phase separation of Al from the solid solution occurs, and Al is precipitated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). At a heating temperature of 600&#xb0; C. or higher, the precipitated Al diffuses to the surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). It was found that in a heating temperature range of 600&#xb0; C. to 800&#xb0; C., performing the acid treatment after the heating treatment makes it possible to reduce the Al contained in Si by about 90%. It is considered that at a heating temperature of 900&#xb0; C. or higher, Al having diffused on the surface may be oxidized together with Si, turn into an (Si, Al) oxide, and remain on the surface even after the acid treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>). The (Si, Al) oxide is considered to be electrochemically inert, and assumed to have a function of strengthening the silicon skeleton by covering the surface of the active material.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0102">Preparation of Power Storage Device</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0103">Next, the charge and discharge characteristics of the power storage device using the silicon materials of Experimental Examples 8 to 12 as a negative electrode active material were examined. Each of the negative electrode active materials (60% by mass) of Examples 8 to 12, 20% by mass of acetylene black having an average particle size of 2 &#x3bc;m as a conductive material, and 20% by mass of polyimide as a binder were mixed together, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred, thereby preparing a slurry. The slurry was then applied to a copper foil having a thickness of 20 &#x3bc;m, then dried, and rolled, thereby preparing a negative electrode having a thickness of 50 &#x3bc;m. It was assumed that the rolling might reduce the porosity of the porous silicon material to about 50% by volume while allowing the porous silicon material to maintain the three-dimensional network structure. The prepared negative electrode was punched into circles having a diameter of 16 mm, a porous polyethylene separator was interposed between the negative electrodes, metallic lithium was stacked thereon as a counter electrode, and an electrolytic solution was injected into the laminate, thereby preparing a Tomcell-type small lithium secondary battery as a test cell. The electrolytic solution used was prepared by adding LiPF<sub>6 </sub>at a concentration of 1 mol/L to a mixed solvent obtained by mixing together fluoroethylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (FEC/EC/DMC/EMC) at a volume ratio of 1.5:3:4:3. The obtained test cell was repeatedly charged and discharged 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C and a battery voltage in a range of 0.005 V to 1.5 V.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0104">Results of Evaluation on Test Cell Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0105">Table 4 shows the initial discharge capacity (mAh/g), the discharge capacity after 50 cycles (mAh/g), and the capacity retention rate (%) obtained from the discharge capacity after 50 cycles with respect to the initial discharge capacity. As shown in Table 4, by the examination on the initial discharge capacity, it was revealed that the test cells of Experimental Examples 8 to 11, in which the heat treatment was performed at 1,000&#xb0; C. in an inert atmosphere after the pore forming treatment, exhibit a discharge capacity of 2,500 mAh/g or more which is a higher discharge capacity. Regarding the durability of the battery, in Experimental Example 12, the capacity retention rate for 50 cycles was 6% which is an extremely low rate. However, in the test cells using the porous silicon materials of Experimental Examples 8 to 11 as a negative electrode active material, the capacity retention rate was 84% to 97% which is an excellent result. Therefore, it was found that making the alloy into a porous material and performing a heat treatment makes it possible to further increase the capacity and the cycle capacity retention rate. It was assumed that by the heat treatment, Al present as a solid solution in the silicon skeleton may be removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, and the purer Si skeleton may further improve the capacity. It was assumed that the formation of the Al oxide on the surface of the silicon skeleton may further strengthen the silicon skeleton, which may lead to further improvement of durability, such as volume change by the charge and discharge cycles.</p>
