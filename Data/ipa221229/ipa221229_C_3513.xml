<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter relates to a niobium carbide-based cemented carbide and method of manufacturing the same and in particular, although not exclusively, to a cemented carbide having a specific microstructure and desired mechanical properties for use in metal forming applications, such as wire drawing and can tooling, as well as metal cutting applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cemented carbides are hard materials that include a hard phase, which is typically hexagonal WC based, along with a ductile metallic binder, which is typically Co-based. Such carbides are commonly referred to as WC-Co based or WC-Co cemented carbides.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">WC-Co based cemented carbides are widely used hard materials for a broad range of applications such as metal cutting and metal forming due to their excellent hardness, toughness and strength, which yields a favorable Transverse Rupture Strength (TRS) value. To improve the mechanical properties and refine the WC grain size, transition metal carbides may be added in small quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, recently, cobalt and tungsten oxides have been identified as having mutagenic, carcinogenic and reproductive toxicity. These oxides may be present as secondary products during WC-Co cemented carbide production. Accordingly, work has been done to identify alternative materials that may be used as a substitute for WC-Co cemented carbides.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cermets, for example, have been explored as a substitute for WC-Co cemented carbides. In high demanding applications, such as the metal cutting industry, cermets are defined as a composite material typically designed TiC&#x2014; or Ti(C,N)-based composites with an fcc hard phase and a Co, Ni or Co/Ni-based binder phase. Like cemented carbides, cermets may also include transition metal carbides, usually in higher quantities compared to WC-Co cemented carbides. However, cermets' sintering cycle is more complicated than that of cemented carbides with respect to the various temperature dwells as well as to the sintering atmosphere. Usually cermets need higher sintering temperatures because of the more stable character of cermet hard phases. Furthermore, if nitrogen is in the starting formulation, the outgassing of nitrogen (at higher temperature than the CO outgassing temperature) can give rise to nitrogen porosity. Thus, cermets usually present a sintering cycle that is more complicated and difficult to control than that of cemented carbides.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Niobium carbide is generally known for its use as a secondary carbide phase in hardmetals. Its addition usually serves either as grain refiner or as secondary hard phase, sometimes known as gamma phase, helping to enhance wear resistance, limit grain growth and improve hot hardness. Compared to WC and Ti(C,N), NbC has a higher melting point, which yields high values for hot hardness. NbC has substantially low density of around 7.79 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is comparable to steel and about half that of WC (15.63 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Niobium, unlike tungsten, is known to be one of the most biocompatible metals. Additionally, Ni powders do not have the same hazardous classification as Co powders.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Like tungsten, niobium may also be used as a hard phase material in cemented carbides or cermets. For example, CN 109439992 discloses a NbC&#x2014;Ni&#x2014; Mo<sub>2</sub>C high temperature hard alloy to reduce crater wear during material processing of an iron-based workpiece. JP 05098383 discloses a cemented carbide suited for decorative materials consisting of NbC, Ni, TaC, Mo and Cr.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">CN 109402479 discloses a NbC-based cermet alloy comprising in wt % 35-90 NbC, 5-30 WC and 5-55% (Nb,M)C wherein M may be any of Mo, W, Ta, Ti, Zr, Cr, V.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, for high demanding applications such as metal cutting and metal forming, existing compositions are not suitable because of their low and unfavorable TRS values. Thus, there is a need to develop new NbC-based cemented carbides that addresses these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is directed to niobium carbide-based cemented carbide materials that are substantially free of Co and WC and have mechanical properties that are advantageous for high demand applications such as metal forming and cutting. It is an objective of the present disclosure to provide a niobium carbide-based cemented carbide material suitable for use in metal forming applications such as wire drawing, rolling and tooling, as well as metal cutting applications. It is a specific objective to provide a niobium carbide-based cemented carbide having enhanced TRS and thermal conductivity whilst exhibiting desired toughness and hardness.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure provides a NbC-based cemented carbide having microstructures having what is generally regarded as a core-rim structure, for which transverse rupture strength is enhanced. In particular, cemented carbide materials according to the present disclosure may comprise a hardness in a range 1300 to 1700 HV30 (ISO 3878:1983). Additionally, the present cemented carbide may comprise a toughness between 7 to 10 MPa&#x221a;{square root over (m)}(Palmqvist, ISO 28079:2009). Additionally, the present cemented carbides may comprise a TRS of greater than about 1300 MPa (ISO 3327:2009), based on Type A test pieces of rectangular cross-section. As will be appreciated, TRS testing is the easiest and most common procedure of analyzing the mechanical strength of carbides. In accordance with the abovementioned standard, TRS values mentioned herein involved a test material of a certain length placed on a surface and put under stress until it breaks. The TRS values herein are the average value of several tests. The very low plastic deformation is normally not considered as it occurs only in the toughest carbides.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors have identified that TRS is largely influenced by the number and size of defects in the microstructure. Fractures always occur at the weakest point of the structure, which is also where the largest defect is. A high number of defects will therefore increase the probability of premature fracture. Thus, in order to reduce the risk of breakage and in turn increase TRS values, the number of defects within the microstructure of the present material is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, the present cemented carbide comprises minimized and preferably no precipitation of additional carbide phases as these would be considered a defect and detrimental to the TRS. The microstructure of the present material may be considered to present a core-rim structure. Typical Ti(CN)-based cermets present a core-rim structure where the core is a remnant of raw Ti(CN) powder and the rim is formed during the sintering process. It is commonly accepted that the compositional factors related to the formation of such core-rim structure in Ti(CN)-based cermets during sintering are a combination of the presence and amounts of: Ti, W, C and N. Typical WC-based cemented carbides do not present a core-rim structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a NbC-based cemented carbide comprising: a binder phase comprising Ni; a hard phase comprising NbC compositionally as the majority component of the hard phase; the hard phase comprising a core-rim structure; wherein the core of said core-rim structure comprises NbC; and the rim of said core-rim structure comprises mixed carbides of any of Nb, Mo and Ta.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference within the specification to a &#x2018;core-rim&#x2019; structure encompass a structure in which the grains of the hard phase (predominantly NbC) are coated, covered, surrounded by or otherwise encapsulated by a further phase that may be regarded a shell, coating or layering to represent a further phase or &#x2018;interphase&#x2019;. Optionally, the further phase comprises at least or predominantly mixed carbides of anyone or a combination of Mo, Ta, Nb.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, reference within this specification to a &#x2018;core-rim&#x2019; or a &#x2018;core-rim structure&#x2019; is to be understood as encompassing a phase having a 3-dimensional configuration (i.e. an encapsulating phase to provide a core-shell structure). Core-rim structure references are understood to constitute one single hard phase comprising different compositions dependent on being part of the core or the rim. However, the person skill in the art would also appreciate that reference to the rim of a core-rim structure could be understood as a hard interphase between the core and the binder phase.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, the inventors have identified that the abovementioned microstructure of the NbC-based cemented carbide provides an enhanced TRS (compared to other systems known in the art)without compromising the desired and advantageous hardness-toughness values.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, composition of the cemented carbide comprises wt % 65-85 NbC; 2-12 Mo<sub>2</sub>C; 0.3-10 TaC; 0-12 or 1-12 WC; 3-25 Ni. In particular, in some aspects substantially all, a majority or a predominant component in wt % of Nb, Mo, Ta and W are present within the hard phase. That is, in certain embodiments, a minor or relatively low amount (i.e. wt % less than 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 or 0.001%) of the total wt % of each of Nb, Mo, Ta and/or W may be present outside/beyond the hard phase. Such minor amounts may be present at the grain boundaries between the hard phase and the binder phase or within the binder phase. In other aspects substantially all, a majority or a predominant component in wt % of Mo and W are present within the binder phase. That is, in certain embodiments, a minor or relatively low amount (i.e. wt % less than 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 or 0.001%) of the total wt % of each of Mo and/or W may be present outside/beyond the binder phase.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, any or all of Nb, Ta, Mo and W may be present in carbide form (MeC), mixed carbide form (Me, Mel, . . . )C and/or elemental form (Me) within the microstructure of the present disclosure, where Me is any one of or a combination of Nb, Mo, Ta, W.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method of making a cemented carbide comprising a binder phase and a hard phase, the hard phase comprising a core-rim structure comprising: preparing a batch of powdered materials including Ni, NbC, Mo<sub>2</sub>C and TaC; pressing the batch of powdered materials to form a pre-form; and sintering the pre-form to form the article.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The powdered materials may be added in any one or in combination of their elemental form, carbide form or mixed carbide form.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect of the present disclosure there is further provided a cemented carbide article obtainable by the methods as claimed and described herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inventors have identified an NbC-based cemented carbide material having improved TRS and thermal conductivity for alike hardness-toughness levels as some WC-based cemented carbides.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The desired physical and mechanical characteristics are achieved, at least in part, by the selection of the metallic binder. Nickel presents good wettability towards the carbide ensuring a good cohesion of the material, which in turn facilitates sintering process and good mechanical properties. However, the relatively high solubility of NbC in nickel promotes certain NbC grain growth during sintering. In order to limit such grain growth, molybdenum may be added either as elemental and/or carbide form (i.e. Mo, MoC and/or Mo<sub>2</sub>C). Known NbC&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Mo systems may present mechanical limitations such as low values for TRS and/or thermal conductivity. Surprisingly, however, the inventors have identified that the addition of tantalum, either in its elemental and/or its carbide form, contributes to the enhancement of such properties.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The inventors have identified that such desired physical and mechanical properties may be achieved via a NbC-based cemented carbide having a microstructure presenting a core-rim structure, for which transverse rupture strength is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Optionally, the Ni content in the cemented carbide is at least 3% or at least 5%, by weight. The Ni may be present 3 to 25 wt %, 3 to 20 wt % or 3 to 15 wt % or in a range 5 to 25 wt %, 5 to 20 wt % or 5 to 15 wt %. Such a configuration provides a contribution to the good toughness values whilst maintaining hardness to an appropriate level, as well as high resistance to corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optionally, the binder phase of the cemented carbide consists of Ni. In particular, the binder phase comprises exclusively or almost exclusively Ni. However, other components of the cemented carbide may be present as minor wt % components within the binder phase. Such minor components may be elemental or compound forms of remaining/other constituents of the cemented carbide such as Nb, Mo, Ta and optionally W and/or Co.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Optionally, the NbC content in the hard phase of the cemented carbide is at least 65 wt %, at least 70 wt %, at least 75 wt %, at least 80 wt %. Optionally, the NbC content in the cemented carbide is in a wt % range 65 to 85, 65 to 83 or 65 to 80. Such configurations provide a contribution to the desired hardness and high hot hardness values, galling and adhesion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, NbC may be the majority wt % component within the hard phase of the cemented carbide. Reference to the majority wt % component encompasses a mass/weight amount of NbC relative to a mass/weight of any other component present within the hard phase.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optionally, NbC may be the majority wt % component within the cemented carbide based on mass/weight content as part of the cemented carbide relative to any other component present within the cemented carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, the Mo<sub>2</sub>C content in the cemented carbide is at least 2 wt % or in a range 2 to 15, 2 to 12, 2 to 10 or 3 to 10. Such a configuration provides a contribution to the good corrosion resistance, maintains the desired mechanical properties including hardness and toughness and acts as a grain refiner. Below 2 wt %, no contribution as a grain refiner would be perceived and as a result, the heterogeneity of the different NbC grain sizes would constitute a defect in the microstructure which would in turn result in lower TRS values. Above the higher end, Mo<sub>2</sub>C would not only be present as a mixed carbide in the rim (or the interphase) of the core-rim structure and dissolved in the binder but would also start precipitating as a further phase. Such precipitation would constitute a defect in the microstructure which would in turn result in lower TRS values.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, the TaC content in the cemented carbide is at least 0.3 wt % or in a range 0.5 to 10, 1 to 9, 1 to 8, 2 to 7 or 2 to 6. Optionally, the TaC content in the cemented carbide is in a range 0.3 to 10, 0.5 to 9, 0.5 to 8, 1 to 7.5, 1 to 7, 1.5 to 7 or 1.5 to 6.5. Such a configuration provides a contribution to the enhanced TRS values as well as thermal conductivity whilst maintaining the desired mechanical properties including hardness and toughness. The addition of tantalum promotes the formation of a core-rim structure. Such core-rim structure constitutes an enhancement of the mechanical properties, in particular the TRS. The rim may act as an interphase between the core and the binder phase, making cracks undergo more deflections, with paths mostly going through the carbide grain/binder interphase, that minimizes crack propagation and in turn enhances the TRS.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, the cemented carbide is devoid of WC. In particular, the hard phase may comprise exclusively or consist of carbides of any combination of Nb, Mo and Ta. Optionally, WC may be included as a minority wt % component, the relative amount of which is less than a wt % of each of NbC, Ni and/or Mo<sub>2</sub>C. Optionally, WC may be included at less than 15 wt %, 10 wt %, 5 wt %, 2 wt %, 1 wt % or 0.5 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, the WC content in the cemented carbide may be at least 1 wt % but less than 15 wt % or in a range 1 to 15 wt %, 1 to 10 wt % or 1 to 5 wt %. Optionally, WC is included as a minority wt % component of the hard phase and/or the cemented carbide. Such configurations are determined due to inevitable impurities present in the production of the present NbC-based cemented carbide, using conventional techniques and equipment that is also used for WC-based cemented carbides. Such configurations also provide a contribution to the good hardness as well as the thermal conductivity. Additionally, such configurations may contribute, according to certain embodiments, to an increasing effect in the enhancement of TRS achieved by the addition of tantalum and/or tantalum carbide. Above 15 wt %, an additional WC phase may start precipitating. Such precipitates would negate the beneficial effect that the addition of TaC and the core-rim structure provides to the cemented carbide by decreasing the TRS values.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0074">Characterization of Samples A to Q was undertaken including also microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sintered samples were mounted in bakelite resin and polished down to 1 &#x3bc;m prior to further characterization.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0075">Crack propagation testing was also conducted. Samples E and N were prepared according to ISO Standard 3327:2009. The face of the rectangular TRS-A samples E and N, to be submitted to tension, were grinded and polished up to a mirror-like surface following standard metallographic preparation according to ASTM standard B665-03: Standard Guide for Metallographic Sample Preparation of Cemented Tungsten Carbide. Three Vickers indentation with tests 30 kg of load were done at the center of each sample, in the polished face, with 1 mm distance between them. This was conducted with an Emco DuraScan Hardness tester machine. Samples were then deposited as for 3-point bending testing in a Shimadzu universal testing machine. The face containing the indentation imprints faced downwards so as to be in tension during the test. Monotonic load was then applied up to rupture of the samples. One of the three indentation imprints promoted rupture, while the other two presented cracks at the corner and grown in direction transversal to the applied load. After testing, the crack path at the crack tip was observed by SEM to qualify the deflection. Observation made far from the nucleation point (i.e. at the indentation imprint) assures that propagation of the crack was done at monotonic load and far from the plastic deformation field of the imprint.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0076">Referring to Table 1 and 2, the present cemented carbide samples combine NbC&#x2014;Ni&#x2014; Mo<sub>2</sub>C system and optimum additions of TaC and optionally WC to form a core-rim (core and shell) structure which results in an enhancement of TRS values. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the microstructure of comparative sample E, which consists of a plain NbC&#x2014;Ni&#x2014; Mo<sub>2</sub>C system. When comparing such microstructure with those of the inventive samples I (addition of 3 wt % TaC) and N (addition of 8 wt % TaC), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>10</b></figref> respectively, the appearance of a core-rim structure can be appreciated. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> presents a typical cemented carbide microstructure with NbC carbide grains (hard phase) surrounded by the binder phase of Ni and the dissolved molybdenum, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>10</b></figref> present a core-rim microstructure where the hard phase is composed by the core and the rim surrounded by the binder phase. The TRS value of comparative sample E is about 1320 MPa, sample I about 1460 MPa and sample N about 1554 MPa. Therefore, it can be seen how the addition of TaC in the composition leads to the formation of a core-rim structure which in turn enhances the TRS values. It is also confirmed that presence of WC is not necessary for such improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0077">Using comparative sample B comparison with sample J which correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>8</b></figref> respectively it can be noted that comparative sample B, which contains an addition of 2 wt % WC, presents a typical cemented carbide microstructure. However, sample J, with the addition of a 3 wt % TaC to the composition the core-rim structure appears and the TRS is increased from about 1121 MPa to about 1540 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0078">The upper limits of the optional addition of WC can be noted by comparing comparative samples C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) with the inventive sample M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> do present a core-rim structure, the wt % amount of WC present is such that it also starts precipitation as a separate secondary hard phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with a composition including 16 wt % WC, shows localized precipitation of (W, Mo)C and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with a composition including 29 wt % WC, shows separate precipitates of WC secondary hard phase in all its microstructure. In contrast, lower amounts of WC addition, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> which includes 4 wt % WC, no separate secondary precipitates can be observed. These precipitates are shown to be detrimental for TRS values as can be seen from Table 2, where the inventive sample shows a value of about 1604 MPa in comparison to comparative samples C and D with TRS values of about 1294 and 931 MPa, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a comparison between microstructures of comparative sample E and inventive sample N is shown. Both microstructures show a crack and its path across the microstructure. It is evidenced that the crack path for comparative sample E, which represents a simple NbC&#x2014;Ni&#x2014; Mo<sub>2</sub>C system, is preferentially transganular (i.e. through the grains). However, for inventive sample E which contains an addition of 8 wt % TaC and presents a core-rim structure, the crack follows an intergranular path preferentially, with minor transgranular fracture. The inventors appreciate the deflection of the crack in sample E is promoted by the microstructure of the composite, influencing the resistance to crack propagation of the material.</p>
