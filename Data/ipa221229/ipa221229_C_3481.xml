<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gene fusion events are chromosomal rearrangements that bring together formerly separate portions of at least two genes in a genome. Gene fusion events can result in cancer fusion genes, where the aberrant juxtaposition of two or more genes can encode a fusion protein, or the regulatory elements of one gene can drive the aberrant expression of an oncogene. Detecting such cancer fusion genes can be difficult. Breakpoint fragments are less likely to hybridize to probes to the same extent as fragments that do not contain breakpoints.

Optimal alignment may be assessed using any suitable parameters of a chosen algorithm, including default parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Hybridization&#x201d; refers to a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence specific manner according to base complementarity. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure, three or more strands forming a multi stranded complex, a single self-hybridizing strand, or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process, such as the initiation of PCR, or the enzymatic cleavage of a polynucleotide by an endonuclease. A second sequence that is complementary to a first sequence is referred to as the &#x201c;complement&#x201d; of the first sequence. The term &#x201c;hybridizable&#x201d; as applied to a polynucleotide refers to the ability of the polynucleotide to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues in a hybridization reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x201c;Specifically hybridize to&#x201d; or &#x201c;hybridizing specifically to&#x201d; or &#x201c;specific hybridization&#x201d; refers to the formation of a stable duplex between two polynucleotides under conditions of 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC and 1% SDS incubated at 42&#xb0; C. or 5&#xd7;SSC and 1% SDS incubated at 65&#xb0; C., with a wash in 0.2&#xd7;SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The term &#x201c;stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; refers to conditions under which a polynucleotide will hybridize preferentially to its target subsequence, and to a lesser extent to, or not at all to, other sequences. &#x201c;Stringent hybridization&#x201d; in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&#x2014;Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes part I chapter 2 &#x201c;Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays&#x201d;, Elsevier, New York.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Generally, highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions are selected to be about 5&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a particular probe.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Stringent hybridization conditions include a buffer comprising water, a buffer (a phosphate, tris, SSPE or SSC buffer at pH 6-9 or pH 7-8), a salt (sodium or potassium), and a denaturant (SDS, formamide or tween) and a temperature of 37&#xb0; C.-70&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C.-65&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An example of stringent hybridization conditions for hybridization of complementary nucleic acids which have more than 100 complementary residues on a filter in a Southern or northern blot is 50% formalin with 1 mg of heparin at 42&#xb0; C., with the hybridization being carried out overnight. An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.15 M NaCl at 72&#xb0; C. for about 15 minutes. An example of stringent wash conditions is a 0.2&#xd7;SSC wash at 65&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes (see, Sambrook et al. for a description of SSC buffer). Often, a high stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. An example medium stringency wash for a duplex of, more than 100 nucleotides, is 1&#xd7;SSC at 45&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e. g., more than 100 nucleotides, is 4-6&#xd7;SSC at 40&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes. In general, a signal to noise ratio of 2&#xd7; (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific hybridization.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">II. Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Provided herein are compositions and methods for detecting polynucleotides comprising one or more fusion genes. The polynucleotides can be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The compositions and methods provided herein can detect fusion genes with high sensitivity in heterogeneous polynucleotide samples, such as cell-free DNA (&#x201c;cfDNA&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">DNA from cells, including cancer cells, can be shed into the blood in the form of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA has an average length of about 160 nucleotides. Because fragmentation does not occur at pre-specified points, for any genomic locus, fragments may be found in a sample that tile across that locus.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In cancer, certain genes are commonly involved in gene fusions with other genes. For example, the EML4 and ALK genes commonly undergo gene fusion with each other in cancer. The breakpoint of each gene involved in a fusion can occur at breakpoint regions (&#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;) in each of the genes. When cells containing these fusion genes die, their DNA is shed into the blood in the form of cfDNA. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the position in the fragment mapping to the breakpoint may occur anywhere in the fragment, near the 5&#x2032; end, in the middle, or near the 3&#x2032; end. Accordingly, the cfDNA polynucleotide can have a very short or a very long nucleotide sequence from either gene involved in the fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Certain DNA sequencing methods use sequence capture to enrich for sequences of interest. Sequence capture typically involves the use of oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the sequence of interest. The probe set strategy can involve tiling the probes across a region of interest. Such probes can be, about 120 bases long. The set can have a depth of about 2&#xd7;. The effectiveness of sequence capture depends, in part, on the length of the sequence in the target molecule that is complementary (or nearly complementary) to the sequence of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">However, in the case of fusion genes, polynucleotides mapping to the breakpoint may contain a sequence from the target gene that is shorter than optimal for hybridization and capture. For example, a cfDNA fragment mapping to a fusion involving an ALK-EML4 fusion may have, for example, a 150 nucleotide sequence of the ALK gene, a 100 nucleotide sequence, a 50 nucleotide sequence, a 25 nucleotide sequence or a 10 nucleotide sequence. In this case, there is a lower probability of capturing the polynucleotide if it has a shorter ALK sequence than of capturing a polynucleotide with a sequence fully complementary to the ALK probe. The problem is more acute when sequence capture is multiplex, targeting sequences from many different genes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Provided herein are materials and methods for capturing polynucleotide fragments mapping to a breakpoint in a fusion gene. Such polynucleotides are captured using high affinity polynucleotide probes, such locked nucleic acids. Such probes have higher melting temperature than probes of the same sequence made from natural nucleotides. Consequently, they produce higher yield of captured products from the same sample.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Such probes can be included in a probe set targeting both fusion genes and non-fused genes. In this way, captured polynucleotides are enriched for those including fusion genes, compared with a population captured using only probes made from natural nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An exemplary probe set can contain, for example, a subset of LNA probes. The LNA probes can be configured to tile across breakpoint regions of genes involved in fusion genes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Every nucleotide in an LNA probe can be an LNA nucleotide. Alternatively, a fraction of the nucleotides can be LNA nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the LNA nucleotides can be spaced a predetermined number of nucleotides apart.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The present invention provides high-affinity polynucleotides that can be used to enrich a sample containing nucleic acid fragments for those nucleic acid fragments that contain gene fusion events. These high-affinity polynucleotides can contain LNA nucleotides. Substituting LNA nucleotides for standard nucleotides can increase the melting temperature of the high-affinity polynucleotide, thereby increasing the stability of the duplex between the high-affinity polynucleotide and a nucleic acid fragment that contains a fusion gene.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Gene fusions can be associated with, and in some cases contribute to, the development of a healthy cell into a neoplasm (a tumor or an adenoma). Detecting these gene fusion events may provide a useful approach for detecting and/or monitoring the presence of a neoplasm in a patient. Breakpoint fragments, however, will have less sequence derived from either gene flanking the breakpoint than a nucleic acid fragment of a similar length comprising sequence from just one of the genes. For this reason, a breakpoint fragment is often only capable of binding to a reduced section of a gene probe or gene-specific oligonucleotide. If the hybridization and wash conditions have been optimized for full-length or near full-length binding, the nucleic acid fragment containing the breakpoint can hybridize with insufficient affinity and be lost (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Furthermore, in a heterogeneous sample containing nucleic acid fragments from cells that have and have not undergone gene fusion events, nucleic acid fragments from those that have not undergone gene fusion events can bind more stably to the gene probe or gene-specific oligonucleotide and competitively inhibit the hybridization of nucleic acid fragments containing breakpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Tumor-derived nucleic acid can be found in cell-free bodily fluids. Tumor-derived nucleic acids from such cell-free bodily fluids can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing fusion genes in order to detect neoplasms. Cell-free bodily fluids can contain small amounts of tumor-derived nucleic acid, and the tumor-derived nucleic acid can be admixed with nucleic acid that is derived from healthy tissue. The present disclosure also provides approaches for enriching for nucleic acid fragments that contain fusion genes from nucleic acid derived from a cell-free bodily fluid.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Test Samples</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A. Subject Types</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Samples are collected from subjects, e.g. patients at risk for developing cancer. The subjects may be patients with no known risk factors for cancer. The subjects can be patients whose only risk factors for cancer are age and/or gender. In some cases, the subjects can have known risk factors for cancer, e.g. smoking or familial history of cancer. In some cases, the subjects can be patients with symptoms of cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Other subjects can be patients with neoplasms that have previously been detected, by colonoscopy or imaging. The samples derived from patients with previously detected neoplasms can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing breakpoints in order to recommend a course of treatment or therapy. The samples derived from patients with neoplasms can be assayed for nucleic acids fragments containing breakpoints in order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment or therapy they are receiving.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Other subjects can be patients with neoplasms that have been previously detected, but in whom the neoplasm is no longer detectable (patients in remission or who have no evidence of disease). The samples derived from patients in whom the neoplasm is no longer detectable can be assayed for nucleic acid fragments containing breakpoints in order to detect a relapse or reemergence of the neoplasm.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Other subjects can be women with a familial history of cancer, wherein the genetic defect responsible for the familial cancer is known or suspected to be a fusion gene. In some cases, a woman with a family history of cancer may be pregnant and want to determine whether the fetus she is carrying has the fusion gene. In some cases, a sample containing fetal nucleic acids from such a subject can be assayed for the gene fusion event.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">B. Sample Types</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Samples can be nucleic acids extracted from various sources. Nucleic acids can be, but are not limited to, genomic DNA, RNA, mitochondrial DNA, fetal DNA, and miRNA.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Samples may be extracted from a variety of bodily fluids containing cell-free nucleic acids, including but not limited to blood, serum, plasma, vitreous, sputum, urine, tears, perspiration, saliva, semen, mucosal excretions, mucus, spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, lymph fluid and the like. The collection of bodily fluids can be achieved using a variety of techniques. In some cases, collection may comprise aspiration of a bodily fluid from a subject using a syringe. In other cases collection may comprise pipetting or direct collection of fluid into a collecting vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">After collection of bodily fluid, cell-free nucleic acids may be isolated and extracted using a variety of techniques. In some cases, cell-free nucleic acids may be isolated, extracted and prepared using commercially available kits such as the Qiagen Qiamp&#xae; Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit protocol. In other examples, Qiagen Qubit&#x2122; dsDNA HS Assay kit protocol, Agilent&#x2122; DNA 1000 kit, or TruSeq&#x2122; Sequencing Library Preparation; Low-Throughput (LT) protocol may be used to quantify nucleic acids. Cell-free nucleic acids may be fetal in origin (via fluid taken from a pregnant subject), or may be derived from tissue of the subject itself. Cell-free nucleic acids can be derived from a neoplasm (e.g. a tumor or an adenoma).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Generally, cell-free nucleic acids are extracted and isolated from bodily fluids through a partitioning step in which cell-free nucleic acids, as found in solution, are separated from cells and other non-soluble components of the bodily fluid. Partitioning may include, but is not limited to, techniques such as centrifugation or filtration. In other cases, cells are not partitioned from cell-free nucleic acids first, but rather lysed. In one example, the genomic DNA of intact cells is partitioned through selective precipitation. Cell-free nucleic acids, including DNA, may remain soluble and may be separated from insoluble genomic DNA and extracted. Generally, after addition of buffers and other wash steps specific to different kits, nucleic acids may be precipitated using isopropanol precipitation. Further clean up steps may be used such as silica based columns to remove contaminants or salts. General steps may be optimized for specific applications. Non-specific bulk carrier nucleic acids, for example, may be added throughout the reaction to optimize certain aspects of the procedure such as yield.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Cell-free nucleic acids can be at most 500 nucleotides in length, at most 400 nucleotides in length, at most 300 nucleotides in length, at most 250 nucleotides in length, at most 225 nucleotides in length, at most 200 nucleotides in length, at most 190 nucleotides in length, at most 180 nucleotides in length, at most 170 nucleotides in length, at most 160 nucleotides in length, at most 150 nucleotides in length, at most 140 nucleotides in length, at most 130 nucleotides in length, at most 120 nucleotides in length, at most 110 nucleotides in length, or at most 100 nucleotides in length.</p>

In particular, cell-free nucleic acids can be between 140 and 180 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A sample may be extracted from tissue from the subject. A sample can be a tumor biopsy. The tumor biopsy can contain a mixture of tumor and healthy tissue.

A sample can be a biopsy from healthy tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Nucleic acids extracted from tissue can be at most 10 kb in length, at most 7 kb in length, at most 5 kb in length, at most 4 kb in length, at most 3 kb in length, at most 2 kb in length, at most 1 kb in length, at most 500 nucleotides in length, at most 400 nucleotides in length, at most 300 nucleotides in length, at most 250 nucleotides in length, at most 225 nucleotides in length, at most 200 nucleotides in length, at most 190 nucleotides in length, at most 180 nucleotides in length, at most 170 nucleotides in length, at most 160 nucleotides in length, at most 150 nucleotides in length, at most 140 nucleotides in length, at most 130 nucleotides in length, at most 120 nucleotides in length, at most 110 nucleotides in length, or at most 100 nucleotides in length.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some cases, nucleic acids can be sheared during the extraction process and comprise fragments between 100 and 400 nucleotides in length. In some cases, nucleic acids can be sheared after extraction can comprise nucleotides between 100 and 400 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Isolation and purification of cell-free and tissue-derived nucleic acids may be accomplished using various approaches, including, but not limited to, the use of commercial kits and protocols provided by companies such as Sigma Aldrich, Life Technologies, Promega, Affymetrix, IBI or the like. Kits and protocols may also be non-commercially available.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV. Genetic Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Genetic analysis includes detection of nucleotide sequence variants, copy number variations, and fusion genes. Genetic variants can be determined by sequencing. The sequencing method can be massively parallel sequencing, that is, simultaneously (or in rapid succession) sequencing any of at least 100,000, 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion polynucleotide molecules. Sequencing methods may include, but are not limited to: high-throughput sequencing, pyrosequencing, sequencing-by-synthesis, single-molecule sequencing, nanopore sequencing, semiconductor sequencing, sequencing-by-ligation, sequencing-by-hybridization, RNA-Seq (Illumina), Digital Gene Expression (Helicos), Next-generation sequencing, Single Molecule Sequencing by Synthesis (SMSS)(Helicos), massively-parallel sequencing, Clonal Single Molecule Array (Solexa), shotgun sequencing, Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger sequencing, primer walking, sequencing using PacBio, SOLiD, Ion Torrent, nanopore-based platforms or other sequencing methods.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Sequencing can be made more efficient by performing sequence capture, that is, the enrichment of a sample for target sequences of interest, sequences of cancer fusion genes and cancer fusion gene breakpoints as described herein. Sequence capture can be performed using immobilized probes that hybridize to the targets of interest. Sequence capture can be performed using probes attached to functional groups, biotin, that allow probes hybridized to specific sequences to be enriched for from a sample by pulldown. In some cases, prior to hybridization to functionalized probes, specific sequences such as adapter sequences from library fragments can be masked by annealing complementary, non-functionalized polynucleotide sequences to the fragments in order to reduce non-specific or off-target binding.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some cases the cell-free nucleic acid fragments or tissue-derived nucleic acid fragments are inputs to produce sequencing libraries. In some cases, the fragments are enriched for specific sequence prior to preparing a sequencing library. The enriched fragmented nucleic acids can be attached to any sequencing adaptor suitable for use on any sequencing platform disclosed herein. For example, a sequence adaptor can comprise a flow cell sequence, a sample barcode, or both. In another example, a sequence adaptor can be a hairpin shaped adaptor and/or comprise a sample barcode. Further, the resulting fragments can be amplified and sequenced. In some cases, the adaptor does not comprise a sequencing primer region. In some cases, the sequencing libraries are enriched for specific sequences prior to sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Cell-free nucleic acids can include small amounts of tumor nucleic acids mixed with germline nucleic acids. In some cases, tumor biopsies can include small amounts of tumor tissue mixed in with healthy tissue, and nucleic acids extracted from such samples without enrichment can include small amounts of tumor nucleic acids mixed with germline nucleic acids. Sequencing methods that increase sensitivity and specificity of detecting tumor nucleic acids, and, in particular, genetic sequence variants and copy number variation, can be useful in the methods of this invention. Such methods are described in, for example, in WO 2014/039556, WO 2014/149134 and WO 2015/100427, each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference. These methods not only can detect molecules with a sensitivity of up to or greater than 0.1%, but also can distinguish these signals from noise typical in current sequencing methods. Increases in sensitivity and specificity from blood-based samples of cell-free nucleic acids can be achieved using various methods. One method includes high efficiency tagging of nucleic acid molecules in the sample, tagging at least any of 50%, 75% or 90% of the polynucleotides in a sample. This increases the likelihood that a low-abundance target molecule in a sample will be tagged and subsequently sequenced, and significantly increases sensitivity of detection of target molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Another method involves molecular tracking, which identifies sequence reads that have been redundantly generated from an original parent molecule, and assigns the most likely identity of a base at each locus or position in the parent molecule. This significantly increases specificity of detection by reducing noise generated by amplification and sequencing errors, which reduces frequency of false positives.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Methods of the present disclosure can be used to detect genetic variation in non-uniquely tagged initial starting genetic material (rare nucleic acids) at a concentration that is less than 5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.01%, at a specificity of at least 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, or 99.99999%. Sequence reads of tagged polynucleotides can be subsequently tracked to generate consensus sequences for polynucleotides with an error rate of no more than 2%, 1%, 0.1%, or 0.01%.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">V. Gene Fusion Events and Breakpoint Regions</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Gene fusion events are chromosomal rearrangements (inversion, deletion, and translocation) that bring together formerly separate portions of at least two different genes in a genome, resulting in a fusion gene. Fusion genes can be associated with and/or cause the formation of a neoplasm. A fusion gene can be a cancer fusion gene. A cancer fusion gene can be a fusion gene resulting from a somatic mutation that is present in a cancer. Non-limiting examples of pairs of genes that may form cancer fusion genes are found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. Non-limiting examples of genes involved in fusion genes are listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows non-limiting examples of genomic regions of the ALK gene that may be targeted for deeper coverage. The genomic regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> may correspond to different variants of the ALK gene. Such deep coverage may be quantified by the number of unique molecules obtained after sequencing and collapsing with molecular barcodes, e.g., about 2-3 thousand molecules for typical variants versus about 4 thousand molecules for the genomic regions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. A range of a few thousand unique molecules may corresponds to greater than 1000&#xd7;, 2000&#xd7;, 3000&#xd7;, 4000&#xd7;, 5000&#xd7;, or 10,000&#xd7; sequencing depth.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Typically, a fusion gene can result in an aberrant juxtaposition of two genes that can encode a fusion protein (BCR-ABL1), or the regulatory elements of one gene may drive the aberrant expression of an oncogene (TMPRSS2-ERG). Despite the recurrent nature of cancer fusion genes, the exact location of the breakpoint for each fusion gene can vary. A breakpoint region refers to a region of a gene that may be involved in gene fusions at which a breakpoint can occur. In some cases, the breakpoint region is at most within 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint. In some cases, the breakpoint region is within at most 200 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 750 nucleotides of a breakpoint, within at most 1 kilobase (kb) of a breakpoint, within at most 5 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 10 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 20 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 30 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 40 kb of a breakpoint, within at most 50 kb of a breakpoint, or within at most 100 kb of a breakpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Exemplary, non-limiting breakpoints for given pairs of genes are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>U</figref> from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC; see Forbes et al., Nucleic Acids Research (2014) 43:D805-D811). For each gene pair, a specific mutation ID is provided in the first column that indicates a particular class of detected or inferred fusion construct from the literature. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> provides <b>29</b> classes of detected or inferred fusion constructs from the literature. For each mutation, the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; fusion partner (5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; are relative to the directionality of each gene's transcript) each provide the gene name, the last observed exon, the inferred breakpoint relative to the transcript, whether there and whether there is inserted sequence. For each mutation ID, a number of unique samples observed with the mutation and the percentage of gene fusions involving the two genes that have that particular mutation are also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, the first row of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> indicates that Mutation COSF463 is an EML4-ALK fusion, wherein the EML4 gene has fused upstream of the ALK gene. In this example, the last observed EML4 exon is exon 13, and the inferred breakpoint is at the genomic position corresponding to position 1751 of the EML4 gene transcript. The EML4 gene has fused such that the first ALK exon after the fusion junction is exon 20, and the inferred breakpoint position is the genomic position corresponding to position 4080 of the ALK gene transcript. There is no additional inserted sequence in either the 5&#x2032; partner or 3&#x2032; partner gene. The COSF463 fusion gene has been detected in 170 unique samples, or 25% of all EML4-ALK fusion genes included in the COSMIC database. In some instances, such COSF488 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, row 5), the inferred breakpoint includes a &#x2018;+&#x2019; followed by a number, denoting a genomic position that number of bases downstream (in an intron or UTR) of the transcript position indicated by the first number. If the number is in parentheses the position is approximate. In some instances, such COSF488 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, row 5), the inferred breakpoint includes a &#x2018;-&#x2019; followed by a number, denoting a genomic position that number of bases upstream (in an intron or UTR) of the transcript position indicated by the first number. If the number is in parentheses the position is approximate. A &#x2018;?&#x2019; indicates that the precise breakpoint is unknown. For example, in COSF488, the breakpoint is 654 bases downstream of the genomic position corresponding to position 2318 of the EML4 gene transcript, which has fused to a position 172 bases upstream of the genomic position corresponding to position 4080 of the ALK gene transcript.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In particular, in some cases high affinity polynucleotides can be between about 20 and about 200 nucleotides in length. Furthermore, in some cases high affinity polynucleotides can be between about 80 and about 160 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In certain embodiments, high affinity polynucleotides of this invention have a sequence of at least 10, least 25, least 50, least 100 or at least 150 nucleotides perfectly complementary or substantially complementary to a target sequence of a fusion gene.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">High affinity polynucleotides can contain one or more LNA nucleotides. In some cases, 100% of the nucleotides within the high affinity polynucleotide are LNA nucleotides. In some cases, at least 90%, at least 70%, at least 50%, at least 20%, at least 10%, at least 5%, or at least 1% of the nucleotides within the high affinity polynucleotides are LNA nucleotides. In some cases, at most 90%, at most 70%, at most 50%, at most 20%, at most 10%, at most 5%, or at most 1% of the nucleotides within the high affinity polynucleotide are LNA nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If a high affinity polynucleotide contains more than one LNA nucleotide, in some cases the LNA nucleotides can be spaced no more than 30 nucleotides apart, no more than 20 nucleotides apart, no more than 15 nucleotides apart, no more than 10 nucleotides apart, or no more than 5 nucleotides apart. In other cases where the high affinity polynucleotide contains more than one LNA nucleotide, the LNA nucleotides can be spaced at least 30 nucleotides apart, at least 20 nucleotides apart, at least 15 nucleotides apart, at least 10 nucleotides apart, or at least 5 nucleotides apart.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">For each LNA nucleotide inserted in place of a natural nucleotide in a high affinity polynucleotide, the melting temperature of the duplex of the high affinity polynucleotide and its complementary sequence comprising only natural nucleotides can increase at least 1&#xb0; C., at least 2&#xb0; C., at least 3&#xb0; C., 4 at least &#xb0; C., at least 5&#xb0; C., at least 6&#xb0; C., at least 7&#xb0; C., at least 8&#xb0; C., at least 9&#xb0; C., or at least 10&#xb0; C. under stringent conditions. In particular, for each LNA nucleotide inserted in place of a natural nucleotide, the melting temperature can increase by between about 2&#xb0; C. and about 8&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some cases, the melting temperature of a high affinity polynucleotide (comprising one or more LNA nucleotides) can be at least 0.5% higher, at least 1% higher, at least 2% higher, at least 3% higher, at least 4% higher, at least 5% higher, at least 10% higher, at least 15% higher, at least 20% higher, at least 25% higher, at least 30% higher, at least 35% higher, at least 40% higher, at least 45% higher, at least 50% higher, at least 55% higher, at least 60% higher, at least 65% higher, at least 70% higher, at least 75% higher, at least 80% higher, at least 85% higher, at least 90% higher, at least 95% higher, or at least 100% higher than the melting temperature of a polynucleotide comprising only natural nucleotides with the same sequence as the high affinity polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one configuration, bound probes may be affinity purified using a combination of binding partners. In one example, probes may contain a binding partner such as biotin. The binding partner may then be used as bait for an additional binding partner, such as streptavidin, in an affinity purification step. In some cases, bound probes may be affinity purified from unbound probes. In other cases, sample polynucleotide strands, comprising a binding partner and bound probes may be affinity purified from unbound probes.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Generally, any chemical approach for capture of the bound probes may be suitable. In some cases, capture may be achieved through methods comprising biotin and streptavidin, or streptavidin derivatives. For example, one embodiment of the disclosure provides for capture of sequencing library fragments of fusion genes, wherein probes to the genes involved in the fusion gene, probes to the breakpoint region, and/or probes to the breakpoint are annealed to melted strands of the sequencing library and affinity purified away from other sequencing library fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Magnetically attractable particles, such as beads, may be used for isolation. Any suitable bead isolation technique can be used with methods of the present disclosure. In some cases, Beads can be useful for isolation in that molecules of interest can be attached to the beads, and the beads can be washed to remove solution components not attached to the beads, allowing for enrichment, purification and/or isolation. The beads can be separated from other components in the solution based on properties such as size, density, or dielectric, ionic, and magnetic properties. In preferred embodiments, the particles are magnetically attractable. Magnetically attractable particles can be introduced, mixed, removed, and released into solution using magnetic fields. Processes utilizing magnetically attractable particles can also be automated. Magnetically attractable particles are supplied by a number of vendors including NEB, Dynal, Micromod, Turbobeads, and Spherotech. The particles can be functionalized using functionalization chemistry to provide a surface having the binding groups required for binding to polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide are configured to hybridize to a cancer fusion gene. For example, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a portion of either gene that the fusion gene is derived from. In some cases, the cancer fusion gene can be one or more genes selected from the lists present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be configured to hybridize to a breakpoint region. For example, in some cases the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a portion of a breakpoint region (the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be complementary to a sequence within 500 nucleotides of a breakpoint). Furthermore, in some cases, the probe and/or high affinity polynucleotide can be configured to hybridize across a breakpoint in a fusion gene (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). For example, the probe and/or polynucleotide can be complementary to a portion of the sequence on each side of a breakpoint (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">VII. Sets of Probes and/or Polynucleotides</heading>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some cases, sets of probes and/or polynucleotides are provided. In some cases, all of the probes and/or polynucleotides in the set comprise LNA nucleotides. In some cases, a subset of the probes and/or polynucleotides in the set comprises only natural nucleotides, referred to hereafter as a &#x201c;standard affinity subset&#x201d;, and a second subset comprising one or more LNA nucleotides, referred to hereafter as a &#x201c;high affinity subset.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one embodiment, the probe set includes one or more probes directed to a nucleotide sequence in a breakpoint region of a fusion gene.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Probes and/or polynucleotides can be provided at a variety of coverage depths. For example, in some cases coverage depth can be at least 0.5&#xd7;, wherein a set of probes or polynucleotides targets on average half of the bases in a region (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some cases, coverage depth can be at least 1&#xd7;, wherein probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that each base in a region is on average targeted by only one probes and/or polynucleotide sequence. In some cases, coverage depth can be at least 2&#xd7;, wherein probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that each base in a region is on average targeted by two probes and/or polynucleotide sequences. In some cases, coverage depth by a set of probes or polynucleotides can be at least 3&#xd7;, at least 4&#xd7;, or at least 5&#xd7;. In some cases, probes and/or polynucleotides can be tiling, wherein a set of probes and/or polynucleotides are designed such that a contiguous target region is covered by the probes and/or polynucleotide sequences (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some cases, it may be preferable to use a standard affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides to enrich for some nucleic acid fragments of interest, and to use a high affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides to enrich for other nucleic acid fragments in the same sample. For example, in some cases a standard affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides can target exomes, oncogenes, or tumor suppressor genes, and a high affinity subset of probes and/or polynucleotides can target fusion genes, such as cancer fusion genes (e.g. the genes listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In another example, in some cases, a standard affinity subset targets with a first coverage depth a contiguous or non-contiguous portion of one or more genes involved in a gene fusion, including the breakpoint regions, and a high affinity subset targets with a second coverage depth the breakpoint region(s) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). In some cases, a standard affinity subset targets with a first coverage depth a contiguous or non-contiguous portion of each of the genes, excluding the breakpoint regions, and a high affinity subset targets with a second coverage depth the breakpoint region(s) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). In some cases, a standard affinity subset targets with a first coverage depth a contiguous or non-contiguous portion of each of the genes, and a high affinity subset targets with a second coverage depth the breakpoints (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). In some cases, a standard affinity subset targets with a first coverage depth a contiguous or non-contiguous portion of each of the genes, and a high affinity subset targets with a second coverage depth the sequence on either side of a breakpoint, but not the breakpoint itself (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some cases, a set of probes and/or polynucleotides is configured to target more than one gene in order to enrich for a panel of genes that may be involved in gene fusions (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Furthermore, in some cases, a set of probes and/or polynucleotides is configured to target more than one gene and their breakpoints or breakpoint regions.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some cases, sets of probes and/or polynucleotides are configured to target a specific fusion gene. For example, the probes and/or polynucleotides can be designed to target one or both genes involved in the gene fusion. In some cases, a set of probes and/or polynucleotides comprises probes and/or polynucleotides that target a single gene and/or its breakpoints or breakpoint regions.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some cases, the standard affinity probes and/or polynucleotides are mixed with the high affinity probes and/or polynucleotides. In some cases, the standard affinity probes and/or polynucleotides and the high affinity probes and/or polynucleotides are separate and employed sequentially. Furthermore, in some cases the sample is first contacted with the standard affinity probes, and then the uncaptured nucleic acid fragments are contacted with the high affinity probes.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some cases, high affinity probe sets can include standard affinity polynucleotides doped with high affinity polynucleotides. In such a probe set, a target sequence can be targeted for hybridization by both standard and high affinity polynucleotides. In such a doped set, the high affinity polynucleotides can target only sequences at a breakpoint region.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">VIII. Kits</heading>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The present disclosure provides kits for enriching samples for breakpoint fragments. The kits can comprise any of the probes and/or polynucleotides disclosed herein. In some cases, the kit can comprise a plurality of probe sets, wherein each probe set hybridizes to a different gene and at least one of the probe sets is configured to hybridize to a fusion gene and comprises one or more high affinity polynucleotides and/or probes.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">IX. Methods of Use</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The present disclosure provides methods for enriching for breakpoint fragments using any of the probes and/or polynucleotides disclosed herein. Such methods can comprise contacting a probe set that hybridizes to a fusion gene, wherein one or more probes and/or polynucleotides is a high affinity polynucleotide and/or probe, with a mixture of polynucleotides to produce probe-captured polynucleotides. The probe-captured polynucleotides can then be isolated to produce a sample enriched for polynucleotides comprising breakpoint fragments of the fusion gene. In some cases, the polynucleotides are cell-free DNA. In some cases, the polynucleotides are fragmented genomic DNA. In some cases, the probe-captured polynucleotides are eluted to isolate the captured polynucleotides form the probes. In some cases, the eluted polynucleotides are directly sequenced or used to produce sequencing libraries.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Methods of detecting fusion genes are provided. In a method, at least one probe set comprising at least one high affinity polynucleotide is provided that is directed to a gene involved in a gene fusion. The probe set can include both standard affinity and high affinity polynucleotide probes. In some embodiments, the probe set comprises a plurality of probe subsets, each subset directed to sequences of a different gene of interest, one or more of which genes are involved in a gene fusion in cancer and, in some examples, at least of which genes is not involved in a gene fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The probe set may be mixed with a sample comprising DNA, such as cfDNA, under stringent hybridization conditions, and the DNA may be allowed to hybridize to the probes. Because the probe set includes high affinity polynucleotide probes, the probability of capturing DNA fragments including a fusion gene break point is increased. Captured DNA may be isolated from the probe and sequenced. Sequences may be analyzed to detect DNA fragments having sequences that span a breakpoint, such as DNA fragments that include sequences from two different genes normally not fused. The presence of fusion genes may be correlated with a disease, such as cancer. Accordingly, this method is useful in the diagnosis of the disease, such as cancer.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 1: Enrichment and Sequencing of Cancer Genes and Cancer Fusion Genes</heading>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Circulating cell-free DNA is isolated from the plasma of a cancer patient using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer's protocol, except that a double sided SPRI with AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter) is performed to removed fragments &#x3e;500 bps and keep all lower molecular weight fragments. The resulting &#x2dc;160-bp cfDNA fragments (5 to 30 ng) are then end-repaired and ligated to adapters with molecular barcode tags and sequences required for downstream next-generation sequencing (HiSeq2500, Illumina). The ligated cfDNA is amplified over 10 cycles using primers complementary to the ligated adapter sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">To enrich for regions of interest, including fusion genes, the resulting cfDNA libraries are denatured at 95&#xb0; C. and then hybridized at 65&#xb0; C. first to oligos that block the added sequences and then to 120-nt biotinylated RNA oligos (Agilent Technologies) and also 120-nt biotinylated RNA/LNA or DNA/LNA oligos (Exiqon) in stringent hybridization buffer for 16 hours. The hybridization reactions are captured using streptavidin beads (Invitrogen), washed to remove non-targeted cfDNA fragments, and eluted using sodium hydroxide. The resulting enriched libraries are amplified for another 12 cycles and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina).</p>
