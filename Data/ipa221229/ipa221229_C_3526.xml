<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) semiconductor device may typically include an integrated circuit in which complementary P-channel and N-channel transistors are formed on a common semiconductor substrate. The CMOS semiconductor device may be provided with a color filter formed of an organic thin film. An organic deposition apparatus may be used to form the organic thin film on the semiconductor substrate. The organic deposition apparatus may include an evaporator which evaporates an organic source. The evaporated organic source may be directly disposed on at the semiconductor substrate, or a showerhead may be used to dispense the evaporated organic source onto the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some example embodiments of the present inventive concepts provide a semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus which is capable of determining a replacement time of an evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some example embodiments of the present inventive concepts, an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device includes a chamber. An evaporator evaporates an organic source to provide a source gas on a substrate within the chamber. A vacuum pump pumps the source gas and air from the chamber. An exhaust line is disposed between the vacuum pump and the chamber. An analyzer is connected to the exhaust line. The analyzer detects a derived molecule produced from the organic source and determines a replacement time of the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some example embodiments of the present inventive concepts, an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device includes a chamber. An evaporator evaporates an organic source to provide a source gas into the chamber. A low vacuum pump pumps the source gas and air in the chamber at a first vacuum pressure. A high vacuum pump pumps the source gas and the air in the chamber at a second vacuum pressure that is greater than the first vacuum pressure. The high vacuum pump is disposed between the low vacuum pump and the chamber. A foreline connects the high vacuum pump to the chamber. An analyzer is disposed on the foreline. The analyzer detects a derived molecule produced from the organic source. A controller receives a detection signal of the derived molecule and obtains a partial pressure of the derived molecule. The controller outputs an interlock control signal to replace the evaporator when the partial pressure increases to a value equal to or greater than a reference partial pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some example embodiments of the present inventive concepts, a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device includes heating an organic source in an evaporator to provide a source gas on a substrate. The source gas, a derived molecule, and air are pumped through an exhaust line connected to a chamber. An analyzer is used to detect the derived molecule. The analyzer is connected to the exhaust line. It is determined whether or not a partial pressure of the derived molecule is equal to or greater than a reference partial pressure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In describing exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for sake of clarity. However, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus <b>100</b> according to some example embodiments of the present inventive concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus <b>100</b> may include a physical vapor deposition (PVD) apparatus or an organic deposition apparatus. Alternatively, the semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus <b>100</b> may include a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) apparatus or a sputter, but the present inventive concepts are not limited thereto and other means of deposition may be used. The semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus <b>100</b> may include, for example, a chamber <b>110</b>, an evaporator <b>120</b>, an exhauster <b>130</b>, a vacuum pump <b>140</b>, an exhaust line <b>150</b>, an analyzer <b>160</b>, and a controller <b>170</b>. As used herein, the evaporator <b>120</b> may be understood to be a device configured to evaporate a material from a solid form to a gaseous form by applying heat to the material in solid form. Thus, the evaporator may be embodied as a heating element. As used herein, the exhauster <b>130</b> may be understood to be a device configured to release or ventilate evaporated particles and other gasses to the outside. Thus, the exhauster, may be a vent or port. As used herein, the analyzer <b>160</b> may be embodied as a computer device, system-on-chip, or some other digital processor in conjunction with one or more sensors. As used herein, the controller <b>170</b> may be embodied as a computer device, system-on-chip, or some other digital processor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The chamber <b>110</b> may hermetically seal a substrate W from the outside. For example, the chamber <b>110</b> may have a showerhead <b>112</b> and a susceptor <b>114</b>. The showerhead <b>112</b> may be disposed in an upper portion of the chamber <b>110</b>. The susceptor <b>114</b> may be placed in a lower portion of the chamber <b>110</b>. The showerhead <b>112</b> may provide the substrate W with a source gas <b>128</b> to deposit an organic thin film. The susceptor <b>114</b> may receive the substrate W thereon. The susceptor <b>114</b> may include a heater plate which heats the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The evaporator <b>120</b> may be connected to the showerhead <b>112</b> of the chamber <b>110</b>. The evaporator <b>120</b> may evaporate an organic source <b>122</b> (e.g. an organic source material in solid form) to provide the source gas <b>128</b> to the showerhead <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the evaporator <b>120</b> may be disposed within the chamber <b>110</b>. For example, the evaporator <b>120</b> may include a crucible or an evaporation boat. The evaporator <b>120</b> may heat the organic source <b>122</b> to a high temperature of about 300&#xb0; C. to produce the source gas <b>128</b>. The organic source <b>122</b> may be evaporated and provided into the chamber <b>110</b>. When the organic source <b>122</b> is entirely evaporated in the evaporator <b>120</b>, the evaporator <b>120</b> may be replaced with an evaporator <b>120</b> having a new source <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, during an idle time, the evaporator <b>120</b> may preliminarily heat the organic source <b>122</b> to temperatures between 200&#xb0; C. and 250&#xb0; C. so that the organic source <b>122</b> does not evaporate but is more ready to evaporate when in use. The organic source <b>122</b> may be thermally degraded either in the evaporator <b>120</b> or in a gas supply line <b>124</b> which will be discussed below, with the result that a derived molecule (or derivative) <b>129</b> may be induced. The derived molecule <b>129</b> may have a chemical composition that is different from that of the source gas <b>128</b>. Each of the organic source <b>122</b> and the source gas <b>128</b> may have a molecular weight equal to or greater than about 300. For example, each of the organic source <b>122</b> and the source gas <b>128</b> may have a molecular weight of about 400 to about 1500. The derived molecule <b>129</b> may be lighter than the source gas <b>128</b>. The derived molecule <b>129</b> may have a molecular weight of about 50 to about 250. For example, the derived molecule <b>129</b> may include anthracene, carbazole, thiophene, and/or aniline. The presence of the derived molecule <b>129</b> may increase a pressure of the chamber <b>110</b>, and thus may cause failure of an organic deposition process. When it is determined that the derived molecule <b>129</b> is produced in large quantity, the evaporator <b>120</b> may be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A gas supply line <b>124</b> and a gas supply valve <b>126</b> may be provided between the evaporator <b>120</b> and the chamber <b>110</b>. The source gas <b>128</b> may be provided through the gas supply line <b>124</b> to the showerhead <b>112</b>. The gas supply line <b>124</b> may be heated to a high temperature of about 250&#xb0; C. to prevent the source gas <b>128</b> from being adsorbed. The gas supply valve <b>126</b> may be installed on the gas supply line <b>124</b>, adjacent to the evaporator <b>120</b>. The gas supply valve <b>126</b> may switch the supply of the source gas <b>128</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exhauster <b>130</b> may be connected to the lower portion of the chamber <b>110</b>. The exhauster <b>130</b> may exhaust the source gas <b>128</b> and air from the chamber <b>110</b>. For example, the exhauster <b>130</b> may include a scrubber. The exhauster <b>130</b> may purge the source gas <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The vacuum pump <b>140</b> may be installed between the exhauster <b>130</b> and the chamber <b>110</b>. The vacuum pump <b>140</b> may pump the source gas <b>128</b> and air from the chamber <b>110</b>. For example, the vacuum pump <b>140</b> may include a low vacuum pump <b>142</b> and a high vacuum pump <b>144</b>. The low vacuum pump <b>142</b> and the high vacuum pump <b>144</b> may be connected in series. The low vacuum pump <b>142</b> may be configured to provide a lower vacuum pressure than the high vacuum pump <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The low vacuum pump <b>142</b> may be connected between the high vacuum pump <b>144</b> and the exhauster <b>130</b>.
