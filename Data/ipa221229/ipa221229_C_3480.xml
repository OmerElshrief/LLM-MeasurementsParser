<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Molecular response is a calculation of the change in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels observed in samples collected from subjects at different time points. In certain cases, the calculation is based on the fraction of somatic variants in the total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in samples. In other cases, the calculation is based on the concentration of ctDNA in the samples (i.e., normalized per the cfDNA concentration in the samples). A common problem associated with these approaches is that these relatively simple calculations of molecular response frequently yield inaccurate or imprecise molecular response scores. Thus, there remains a need for methods for accurately determining molecular response scores for subjects having cancer.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0057">About: As used herein, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; as applied to one or more values or elements of interest, refers to a value or element that is similar to a stated reference value or element. In certain embodiments, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; refers to a range of values or elements that falls within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated reference value or element unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value or element).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0058">Adapter: As used herein, &#x201c;adapter&#x201d; refers to short nucleic acids (e.g., less than about 500, less than about 100 or less than about 50 nucleotides in length) that are typically at least partially double-stranded and used to link to either or both ends of a given sample nucleic acid molecule. Adapters can include nucleic acid primer binding sites to permit amplification of a nucleic acid molecule flanked by adapters at both ends, and/or a sequencing primer binding site, including primer binding sites for sequencing applications, such as various next generation sequencing (NGS) applications. Adapters can also include binding sites for capture probes, such as an oligonucleotide attached to a flow cell support or the like. Adapters can also include a nucleic acid tag as described herein. Nucleic acid tags are typically positioned relative to amplification primer and sequencing primer binding sites, such that a nucleic acid tag is included in amplicons and sequencing reads of a given nucleic acid molecule. The same or different adapters can be linked to the respective ends of a nucleic acid molecule. In certain embodiments, the same adapter is linked to the respective ends of the nucleic acid molecule except that the nucleic acid tag differs. In some embodiments, the adapter is a Y-shaped adapter in which one end is blunt ended or tailed as described herein, for joining to a nucleic acid molecule, which is also blunt ended or tailed with one or more complementary nucleotides. In still other exemplary embodiments, an adapter is a bell-shaped adapter that includes a blunt or tailed end for joining to a nucleic acid molecule to be analyzed. Other exemplary adapters include T-tailed and C-tailed adapters.</p>

Administration can be accomplished by any of a number of routes, including, for example, topical, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intrathecal and intradermal.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0060">Allele: As used herein, &#x201c;allele&#x201d; or &#x201c;allelic variant&#x201d; refers to a specific genetic variant at defined genomic location or locus. An allelic variant is usually presented at a frequency of 50% (0.5) or 100%, depending on whether the allele is heterozygous or homozygous. For example, germline variants are inherited and usually have a frequency of 0.5 or 1. Somatic variants; however, are acquired variants and usually have a frequency of &#x3c;0.5. Major and minor alleles of a genetic locus refer to nucleic acids harboring the locus in which the locus is occupied by a nucleotide of a reference sequence, and a variant nucleotide different than the reference sequence respectively. Measurements at a locus can take the form of allelic fractions (AFs), which measure the frequency with which an allele is observed in a sample.</p>

Nucleic acid tags can be single stranded, double stranded or at least partially double stranded. Nucleic acid tags optionally have the same length or varied lengths. Nucleic acid tags can also include double-stranded molecules having one or more blunt-ends, include 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; single-stranded regions (e.g., an overhang), and/or include one or more other single-stranded regions at other locations within a given molecule. Nucleic acid tags can be attached to one end or both ends of the other nucleic acids (e.g., sample nucleic acids to be amplified and/or sequenced). Nucleic acid tags can be decoded to reveal information such as the sample of origin, form or processing of a given nucleic acid. Nucleic acid tags can also be used to enable pooling and/or parallel processing of multiple samples comprising nucleic acids bearing different nucleic acid tags and/or sample indexes in which the nucleic acids are subsequently being deconvoluted by reading the nucleic acid tags. Nucleic acid tags can also be referred to as molecular identifiers or tags, sample identifiers, index tags, and/or barcodes. Additionally or alternatively, nucleic acid tags can be used to distinguish different molecules in the same sample. This includes, for example, uniquely tagging each different nucleic acid molecule in a given sample, or non-uniquely tagging such molecules. In the case of non-unique tagging applications, a limited number of tags may be used to tag each nucleic acid molecule such that different molecules can be distinguished based on, for example, start/stop positions where they map to a selected reference genome in combination with at least one nucleic acid tag. Typically, a sufficient number of different nucleic acid tags are used such that there is a low probability (e.g., less than about a 10%, less than about a 5%, less than about a 1%, or less than about a 0.1% chance) that any two molecules will have the same start/stop positions and also have the same nucleic acid tag. Some nucleic acid tags include multiple molecular identifiers to label samples, forms of nucleic acid molecules within a sample, and nucleic acid molecules within a form having the same start and stop positions. Such nucleic acid tags can be referenced using the exemplary form &#x201c;Ali&#x201d; in which the uppercase letter indicates a sample type, the Arabic numeral indicates a form of molecule within a sample, and the lowercase Roman numeral indicates a molecule within a form.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">II. Molecular Response Scoring</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0106">In an embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a method <b>100</b> for determining a Molecular response (MR) score is disclosed. The methods of this disclosure may have a wide variety of uses in the manipulation, preparation, identification, quantification, and/or analysis of cell-free nucleic acids. Molecular response is an assessment of the change in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) load on-treatment (usually 3-10 weeks) in comparison to pre-treatment baseline. Molecular response is associated with patient response to therapy and long term outcomes across solid tumors and therapy types. Molecular response can also be used to predict clinical response earlier than radiographic and/or RECIST response. Multiple methods have been used to calculate molecular response and there is no consensus regarding which method is best.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0107">Methods and systems are described for assessing response to treatment using a molecular response (MR) score. In an embodiment, baseline (pre-treatment) gene expression data may be obtained for a plurality of patients prior to treatment and on-treatment gene expression data may be obtained for the plurality of patients during treatment. In an embodiment, the baseline gene expression data (e.g., variant data) and/or the on-treatment gene expression data may be analyzed to determine a molecular response (MR) score. The MR score may indicate that a patient is a responder or a non-responder to the treatment. In an embodiment, a mutant allele fraction (MAF) may be determined as part of the MR score. In an embodiment, the variance of each MAF may be incorporated into the determination of the molecular response score. This ensures molecular response scores include accurate variance, which provides a significant improvement in making a correct conclusion from the molecular response score. The improvement is even more pronounced when the molecular response score is a ratio, as a ratio is sensitive to variance in the denominator. The variance can be incorporated into the molecular response score either through deriving mathematically the molecular response variance or through simulation or sampling from the variance distribution of each variant to determine the molecular response variance.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, at a first time T<sub>0</sub>, baseline cfDNA may be obtained from one or more baseline samples obtained from one or more subjects prior to treatment at step <b>101</b> and at a second time T<sub>1</sub>, on-treatment cfDNA may be obtained from one or more on-treatment samples obtained from one or more subjects after treatment at step <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0115" num="0110">As described herein, a polynucleotide can comprise any type of nucleic acid, such as DNA and/or RNA. For example, if a polynucleotide is DNA, it can be genomic DNA, complementary DNA (cDNA), or any other deoxyribonucleic acid. A polynucleotide can also be a cell-free nucleic acid such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). For example, the polynucleotide can be circulating cfDNA. Circulating cfDNA may comprise DNA shed from bodily cells via apoptosis or necrosis. cfDNA shed via apoptosis or necrosis may originate from normal (e.g. healthy) bodily cells. Where there is abnormal tissue growth, such as for cancer, tumor DNA may be shed. The circulating cfDNA can comprise circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0111">i. Samples</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0112">Isolation and extraction of cell free polynucleotides may be performed through collection of samples using a variety of techniques. A sample can be any biological sample isolated from a subject. Samples can include body tissues, whole blood, platelets, serum, plasma, stool, red blood cells, white blood cells or leucocytes, endothelial cells, tissue biopsies (e.g., biopsies from known or suspected solid tumors), cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, lymphatic fluid, ascites fluid, interstitial or extracellular fluid (e.g., fluid from intercellular spaces), gingival fluid, crevicular fluid, bone marrow, pleural effusions, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, mucous, sputum, semen, sweat, urine. Samples are preferably body fluids, particularly blood and fractions thereof, and urine. Such samples include nucleic acids shed from tumors. The nucleic acids can include DNA and RNA and can be in double and single-stranded forms. A sample can be in the form originally isolated from a subject or can have been subjected to further processing to remove or add components, such as cells, enrich for one component relative to another, or convert one form of nucleic acid to another, such as RNA to DNA or single-stranded nucleic acids to double-stranded. Thus, for example, a body fluid sample for analysis is plasma or serum containing cell-free nucleic acids, e.g., cell-free DNA (cfDNA).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0113">In some embodiments, the sample volume of body fluid taken from a subject depends on the desired read depth for sequenced regions. Exemplary volumes are about 0.4-40 ml, about 5-20 ml, about 10-20 ml. For example, the volume can be about 0.5 ml, about 1 ml, about 5 ml, about 10 ml, about 20 ml, about 30 ml, about 40 ml, or more milliliters. A volume of sampled blood is typically between about 5 ml to about 20 ml.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0114">The sample can comprise various amounts of nucleic acid. Typically, the amount of nucleic acid in a given sample is equated with multiple genome equivalents. For example, a sample of about 30 ng DNA can contain about 10,000 (<b>10</b><sup>4</sup>) haploid human genome equivalents and, in the case of cfDNA, about 200 billion (2&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>) individual polynucleotide molecules. Similarly, a sample of about 100 ng of DNA can contain about 30,000 haploid human genome equivalents and, in the case of cfDNA, about 600 billion individual molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0115">In some embodiments, a sample comprises nucleic acids from different sources, e.g., from cells and from cell-free sources (e.g., blood samples, etc.). Typically, a sample includes nucleic acids carrying mutations. For example, a sample optionally comprises DNA carrying germline mutations and/or somatic mutations. Typically, a sample comprises DNA carrying cancer-associated mutations (e.g., cancer-associated somatic mutations). In some embodiments of the present disclosure, cell free nucleic acids in a subject may derive from a tumor. For example cell-free DNA isolated from a subject can comprise ctDNA.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0116">Exemplary amounts of cell-free nucleic acids in a sample before amplification typically range from about 1 femtogram (fg) to about 1 microgram (&#x3bc;g), e.g., about 1 picogram (pg) to about 200 nanogram (ng), about 1 ng to about 100 ng, about 10 ng to about 1000 ng. In some embodiments, a sample includes up to about 600 ng, up to about 500 ng, up to about 400 ng, up to about 300 ng, up to about 200 ng, up to about 100 ng, up to about 50 ng, or up to about 20 ng of cell-free nucleic acid molecules. Optionally, the amount is at least about 1 fg, at least about 10 fg, at least about 100 fg, at least about 1 pg, at least about 10 pg, at least about 100 pg, at least about 1 ng, at least about 10 ng, at least about 100 ng, at least about 150 ng, or at least about 200 ng of cell-free nucleic acid molecules. In certain embodiments, the amount is up to about 1 fg, about 10 fg, about 100 fg, about 1 pg, about 10 pg, about 100 pg, about 1 ng, about 10 ng, about 100 ng, about 150 ng, or about 200 ng of cell-free nucleic acid molecules. In some embodiments, methods include obtaining between about 1 fg to about 200 ng cell-free nucleic acid molecules from samples.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0117">Cell-free nucleic acids typically have a size distribution of between about 100 nucleotides in length and about 500 nucleotides in length, with molecules of about 110 nucleotides in length to about 230 nucleotides in length representing about 90% of molecules in the sample, with a mode of about 168 nucleotides length and a second minor peak in a range between about 240 to about 440 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, cell-free nucleic acids are from about 160 to about 180 nucleotides in length, or from about 320 to about 360 nucleotides in length, or from about 440 to about 480 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0118">In some embodiments, cell-free nucleic acids are isolated from bodily fluids through a partitioning step in which cell-free nucleic acids, as found in solution, are separated from intact cells and other non-soluble components of the bodily fluid. In some of these embodiments, partitioning includes techniques such as centrifugation or filtration. Alternatively, cells in bodily fluids are lysed, and cell-free and cellular nucleic acids processed together. Generally, after addition of buffers and wash steps, cell-free nucleic acids are precipitated with, for example, an alcohol. In certain embodiments, additional clean up steps are used, such as silica-based columns to remove contaminants or salts. Non-specific bulk carrier nucleic acids, for example, are optionally added throughout the reaction to optimize certain aspects of the exemplary procedure, such as yield. After such processing, samples typically include various forms of nucleic acids including double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA and/or single-stranded RNA. Optionally, single stranded DNA and/or single stranded RNA are converted to double stranded forms so that they are included in subsequent processing and analysis steps. Additional details regarding cfDNA partitioning and related analysis of epigenetic modifications that are optionally adapted for use in performing the methods disclosed herein are described in, for example, WO 2018/119452, filed Dec. 22, 2017, which is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0119">ii. Nucleic Acid Tags</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0120">In certain embodiments, tags providing molecular identifiers or barcodes are incorporated into or otherwise joined to adapters by chemical synthesis, ligation, or overlap extension PCR, among other methods. In some embodiments, the assignment of unique or non-unique identifiers, or molecular barcodes in reactions follows methods and utilizes systems described in, for example, US patent applications 20010053519, 20030152490, 20110160078, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,582,908, 7,537,898, and 9,598,731, which are each incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0121">Tags are linked (e.g., ligated) to sample nucleic acids randomly or non-randomly. In some embodiments, tags are introduced at an expected ratio of identifiers (e.g., a combination of unique and/or non-unique barcodes) to microwells. For example, the identifiers may be loaded so that more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers are loaded per genome sample. In some embodiments, the identifiers are loaded so that less than about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers are loaded per genome sample. In certain embodiments, the average number of identifiers loaded per sample genome is less than, or greater than, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 50,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 identifiers per genome sample. The identifiers are generally unique or non-unique.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0122">One exemplary format uses from about 2 to about 1,000,000 different tags, or from about 5 to about 150 different tags, or from about 20 to about 50 different tags, ligated to both ends of a target nucleic acid molecule. For 20-50&#xd7;20-50 tags, a total of 400-2500 tags are created. Such numbers of tags are typically sufficient for different molecules having the same start and stop points to have a high probability (e.g., at least 94%, 99.5%, 99.99%, 99.999%) of receiving different combinations of tags.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0123">In some embodiments, identifiers are predetermined, random, or semi-random sequence oligonucleotides. In other embodiments, a plurality of barcodes may be used such that barcodes are not necessarily unique to one another in the plurality. In these embodiments, barcodes are generally attached (e.g., by ligation or PCR amplification) to individual molecules such that the combination of the barcode and the sequence it may be attached to creates a unique sequence that may be individually tracked. As described herein, detection of non-uniquely tagged barcodes in combination with sequence data of beginning (start) and end (stop) portions of sequence reads typically allows for the assignment of a unique identity to a particular molecule. The length, or number of base pairs, of an individual sequence read are also optionally used to assign a unique identity to a given molecule. As described herein, fragments from a single strand of nucleic acid having been assigned a unique identity, may thereby permit subsequent identification of fragments from the parent strand, and/or a complementary strand.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0124">iii. Nucleic Acid Amplification</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0125">Sample nucleic acids flanked by adapters are typically amplified by PCR and other amplification methods using nucleic acid primers binding to primer binding sites in adapters flanking a DNA molecule to be amplified. In some embodiments, amplification methods involve cycles of extension, denaturation and annealing resulting from thermocycling, or can be isothermal as, for example, in transcription mediated amplification. Other exemplary amplification methods that are optionally utilized, include the ligase chain reaction, strand displacement amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and self-sustained sequence-based replication, among other approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0126">One or more rounds of amplification cycles are generally applied to introduce sample indexes/tags to a nucleic acid molecule using conventional nucleic acid amplification methods. The amplifications are typically conducted in one or more reaction mixtures. In some embodiments, molecular tags and sample indexes/tags are introduced prior to and/or after sequence capturing steps are performed. In some embodiments, only the molecular tags are introduced prior to probe capturing and the sample indexes/tags are introduced after sequence capturing steps are performed. In certain embodiments, both the molecular tags and the sample indexes/tags are introduced prior to performing probe-based capturing steps. In some embodiments, the sample indexes/tags are introduced after sequence capturing steps (i.e., enrichment of nucleic acids) are performed. Typically, sequence capturing protocols involve introducing a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule complementary to a targeted nucleic acid sequence, e.g., a coding sequence of a genomic region and mutation of such region associated with a cancer type. Typically, the amplification reactions generate a plurality of non-uniquely or uniquely tagged nucleic acid amplicons with molecular tags and sample indexes/tags at size ranging from about 200 nucleotides (nt) to about 700 nt, from 250 nt to about 350 nt, or from about 320 nt to about 550 nt. In some embodiments, the amplicons have a size of about 300 nt. In some embodiments, the amplicons have a size of about 500 nt.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0127">iv. Nucleic Acid Enrichment</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0128">In some embodiments, sequences are enriched prior to sequencing the nucleic acids. Enrichment is optionally performed for specific target regions or nonspecifically (&#x201c;target sequences&#x201d;). By way of example, enrichment may be performed nonspecifically based on a size selection method that is not sequence specific but rather is sequence fragment size specific. In some embodiments, targeted regions of interest may be enriched with nucleic acid capture probes (&#x201c;baits&#x201d;) selected for one or more bait set panels using a differential tiling and capture scheme. A differential tiling and capture scheme generally uses bait sets of different relative concentrations to differentially tile (e.g., at different &#x201c;resolutions&#x201d;) across genomic sections associated with the baits, subject to a set of constraints (e.g., sequencer constraints such as sequencing load, utility of each bait, etc.), and capture the targeted nucleic acids at a desired level for downstream sequencing. These targeted genomic sections of interest optionally include natural or synthetic nucleotide sequences of the nucleic acid construct. In some embodiments, biotin-labeled beads with probes to one or more sections of interest can be used to capture target sequences, and optionally followed by amplification of those sections, to enrich for the regions of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0129">Sequence capture typically involves the use of oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the target nucleic acid sequence. In certain embodiments, a probe set strategy involves tiling the probes across a section of interest. Such probes can be, for example, from about 60 to about 120 nucleotides in length. The set can have a depth of about 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 5&#xd7;, 6&#xd7;, 8&#xd7;, 9&#xd7;, 10&#xd7;, 15&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 50&#xd7; or more. The effectiveness of sequence capture generally depends, in part, on the length of the sequence in the target molecule that is complementary (or nearly complementary) to the sequence of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0130">b. Nucleic Acid Sequencing</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, after extraction and isolation of cfDNA from samples at steps <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, the cfDNA may be sequenced at steps <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. Sample nucleic acids, optionally flanked by adapters, with or without prior amplification are generally subject to sequencing. Sequencing methods or commercially available formats that are optionally utilized include, for example, Sanger sequencing, high-throughput sequencing, bisulfate sequencing, pyrosequencing, sequencing-by-synthesis, single-molecule sequencing, nanopore-based sequencing, semiconductor sequencing, sequencing-by-ligation, sequencing-by-hybridization, RNA-Seq (Illumina), Digital Gene Expression (Helicos), next generation sequencing (NGS), Single Molecule Sequencing by Synthesis (SMSS) (Helicos), massively-parallel sequencing, Clonal Single Molecule Array (Solexa), shotgun sequencing, Ion Torrent, Oxford Nanopore, Roche Genia, primer walking, sequencing using PacBio, SOLiD, Ion Torrent, or nanopore platforms. Sequencing reactions can be performed in a variety of sample processing units, which may include multiple lanes, multiple channels, multiple wells, or other means of processing multiple sample sets substantially simultaneously. Sample processing units can also include multiple sample chambers to enable the processing of multiple runs simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0132">The sequencing reactions can be performed on one more nucleic acid fragment types or sections known to contain markers of cancer or of other diseases. The sequencing reactions can also be performed on any nucleic acid fragment present in the sample. The sequence reactions may provide for sequence coverage of the genome of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9% or 100% of the genome. In other cases, sequence coverage of the genome may be less than about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9% or 100% of the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0133">Simultaneous sequencing reactions may be performed using multiplex sequencing techniques. In some embodiments, cell-free polynucleotides are sequenced with at least about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 50000, or 100,000 sequencing reactions. In other embodiments, cell-free polynucleotides are sequenced with less than about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 50000, or 100,000 sequencing reactions. Sequencing reactions are typically performed sequentially or simultaneously. Subsequent data analysis is generally performed on all or part of the sequencing reactions. In some embodiments, data analysis is performed on at least about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 50000, or 100,000 sequencing reactions. In other embodiments, data analysis may be performed on less than about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 50000, or 100,000 sequencing reactions. An exemplary read depth is from about 1000 to about 50000 reads per locus (base position).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0134">In some embodiments, a nucleic acid population is prepared for sequencing by enzymatically forming blunt-ends on double-stranded nucleic acids with single-stranded overhangs at one or both ends. In these embodiments, the population is typically treated with an enzyme having a 5&#x2032;-3&#x2032; DNA polymerase activity and a 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; exonuclease activity in the presence of the nucleotides (e.g., A, C, G and T or U). Exemplary enzymes or catalytic fragments thereof that are optionally used include Klenow large fragment and T4 polymerase. At 5&#x2032; overhangs, the enzyme typically extends the recessed 3&#x2032; end on the opposing strand until it is flush with the 5&#x2032; end to produce a blunt end. At 3&#x2032; overhangs, the enzyme generally digests from the 3&#x2032; end up to and sometimes beyond the 5&#x2032; end of the opposing strand. If this digestion proceeds beyond the 5&#x2032; end of the opposing strand, the gap can be filled in by an enzyme having the same polymerase activity that is used for 5&#x2032; overhangs. The formation of blunt-ends on double-stranded nucleic acids facilitates, for example, the attachment of adapters and subsequent amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0135">In some embodiments, nucleic acid populations are subject to additional processing, such as the conversion of single-stranded nucleic acids to double-stranded and/or conversion of RNA to DNA. These forms of nucleic acid are also optionally linked to adapters and amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0136">With or without prior amplification, nucleic acids subject to the process of forming blunt-ends described above, and optionally other nucleic acids in a sample, can be sequenced to produce sequenced nucleic acids. A sequenced nucleic acid can refer either to the sequence of a nucleic acid (i.e., sequence information) or a nucleic acid whose sequence has been determined. Sequencing can be performed so as to provide sequence data of individual nucleic acid molecules in a sample either directly or indirectly from a consensus sequence of amplification products of an individual nucleic acid molecule in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0137">In some embodiments, double-stranded nucleic acids with single-stranded overhangs in a sample after blunt-end formation are linked at both ends to adapters including barcodes, and the sequencing determines nucleic acid sequences as well as in-line barcodes introduced by the adapters. The blunt-end DNA molecules are optionally ligated to a blunt end of an at least partially double-stranded adapter (e.g., a Y shaped or bell-shaped adapter). Alternatively, blunt ends of sample nucleic acids and adapters can be tailed with complementary nucleotides to facilitate ligation (e.g., sticky end ligation).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0138">The nucleic acid sample is typically contacted with a sufficient number of adapters such that there is a low probability (e.g., &#x3c;1 or 0.1%) that any two copies of the same nucleic acid receive the same combination of adapter barcodes from the adapters linked at both ends. The use of adapters in this manner permits identification of families of nucleic acid sequences with the same start and stop points on a reference nucleic acid and linked to the same combination of barcodes. Such a family represents sequences of amplification products of a template/parent nucleic acid in the sample before amplification. The sequences of family members can be compiled to derive consensus nucleotide(s) or a complete consensus sequence for a nucleic acid molecule in the original sample, as modified by blunt end formation and adapter attachment. In other words, the nucleotide occupying a specified position of a nucleic acid in the sample is determined to be the consensus of nucleotides occupying that corresponding position in family member sequences. Families can include sequences of one or both strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid. If members of a family include sequences of both strands from a double-stranded nucleic acid, sequences of one strand are converted to their complement for purposes of compiling all sequences to derive consensus nucleotide(s) or sequences. Some families include only a single member sequence. In this case, this sequence can be taken as the sequence of a nucleic acid in the sample before amplification. Alternatively, families with only a single member sequence may be eliminated from subsequent analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0139">Nucleotide variations in sequenced nucleic acids can be determined by comparing sequenced nucleic acids with a reference sequence. The reference sequence is often a known sequence, e.g., a known whole or partial genome sequence from a subject (e.g., a whole genome sequence of a human subject). The reference sequence can be, for example, hG19 or hG38. The sequenced nucleic acids can represent sequences determined directly for a nucleic acid in a sample, or a consensus of sequences of amplification products of such a nucleic acid, as described above. A comparison can be performed at one or more designated positions on a reference sequence. A subset of sequenced nucleic acids can be identified including a position corresponding with a designated position of the reference sequence when the respective sequences are maximally aligned. Within such a subset it can be determined which, if any, sequenced nucleic acids include a nucleotide variation at the designated position, the length of a given cfDNA fragment based upon where its endpoints (i.e., it 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; terminal nucleotides) map to the reference sequence, the offset of a midpoint of a given cfDNA fragment from a midpoint of a genomic region in the cfDNA fragment, and optionally which if any, include a reference nucleotide (i.e., same as in the reference sequence). If the number of sequenced nucleic acids in the subset including a nucleotide variant exceeding a selected threshold, then a variant nucleotide can be called at the designated position. The threshold can be a simple number, such as at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10 sequenced nucleic acids within the subset including the nucleotide variant or it can be a ratio, such as a least 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, or 20 of sequenced nucleic acids within the subset that include the nucleotide variant, among other possibilities. The comparison can be repeated for any designated position of interest in the reference sequence. Sometimes a comparison can be performed for designated positions occupying at least about 20, 100, 200, or 300 contiguous positions on a reference sequence, e.g., about 20-500, or about 50-300 contiguous positions.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0141">i. Sequencing Panel</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0142">To improve the likelihood of detecting genomic regions of interest and optionally, tumor indicating mutations, the sections of DNA sequenced may comprise a panel of genes or genomic sections that comprise known genomic regions. Selection of a limited section for sequencing (e.g., a limited panel) can reduce the total sequencing needed (e.g., a total amount of nucleotides sequenced). A sequencing panel can target a plurality of different genes or regions, for example, to detect a single cancer, a set of cancers, or all cancers. Alternatively, DNA may be sequenced by whole genome sequencing (WGS) or other unbiased sequencing method without the use of a sequencing panel. Examples of suitable panel and targets for use in panels can be found in the epigenetic targets described in U.S. provisional patent application 62/799,637, filed Jan. 31, 2019, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0143">In some aspects, a panel that targets a plurality of different genes or genomic regions (e.g., transcriptional factor binding regions, distal regulatory elements (DREs), repetitive elements, intron-exon junctions, transcriptional start sites (TSSs), and/or the like) is selected such that a determined proportion of subjects having a cancer exhibits a genetic variant or tumor marker in one or more different genes in the panel. The panel may be selected to limit a region for sequencing to a fixed number of base pairs. The panel may be selected to sequence a desired amount of DNA. The panel may be further selected to achieve a desired sequence read depth. The panel may be selected to achieve a desired sequence read depth or sequence read coverage for an amount of sequenced base pairs. The panel may be selected to achieve a theoretical sensitivity, a theoretical specificity, and/or a theoretical accuracy for detecting one or more genetic variants in a sample.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0144">Probes for detecting the panel of regions can include those for detecting genomic regions of interest (hotspot regions) as well as nucleosome-aware probes (e.g., KRAS codons <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>) and may be designed to optimize capture based on analysis of cfDNA coverage and fragment size variation impacted by nucleosome binding patterns and GC sequence composition. Regions used herein can also include non-hotspot regions optimized based on nucleosome positions and GC models. The panel can comprise a plurality of subpanels, including subpanels for identifying tissue of origin (e.g., use of published literature to define 50-100 baits representing genes with most diverse transcription profile across tissues (not necessarily promoters)), whole genome scaffold (e.g., for identifying ultra-conservative genomic content and tiling sparsely across chromosomes with handful of probes for copy number base lining purposes), transcription start site (TSS)/CpG islands (e.g., for capturing differential methylated regions (e.g., Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs)) in for example in promoters of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., SEPT9/VIM in colorectal cancer)). In some embodiments, markers for a tissue of origin are tissue-specific epigenetic markers.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0146">In some embodiments, the one or more regions in the panel comprise one or more loci from one or a plurality of genes for detecting residual cancer after surgery. This detection can be earlier than is possible for existing methods of cancer detection. In some embodiments, the one or more genomic locations in the panel comprise one or more loci from one or a plurality of genes for detecting cancer in a high-risk patient population. For example, smokers have much higher rates of lung cancer than the general population. Moreover, smokers can develop other lung conditions that make cancer detection more difficult, such as the development of irregular nodules in the lungs. In some embodiments, the methods described herein detect the response of patients to cancer therapy (particularly in high risk patients) earlier than is possible for existing methods of cancer detection.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0147">A genomic location may be selected for inclusion in a sequencing panel based on a number of subjects with a cancer that have a tumor marker in that gene or region. A genomic location may be selected for inclusion in a sequencing panel based on prevalence of subjects with a cancer and a tumor marker present in that gene. Presence of a tumor marker in a region may be indicative of a subject having cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0148">In some instances, the panel may be selected using information from one or more databases. The information regarding a cancer may be derived from cancer tumor biopsies or cfDNA assays. A database may comprise information describing a population of sequenced tumor samples. A database may comprise information about mRNA expression in tumor samples. A database may comprise information about regulatory elements or genomic regions in tumor samples. The information relating to the sequenced tumor samples may include the frequency of various genetic variants and describe the genes or regions in which the genetic variants occur. The genetic variants may be tumor markers. A non-limiting example of such a database is COSMIC. COSMIC is a catalogue of somatic mutations found in various cancers. For a particular cancer, COSMIC ranks genes based on frequency of mutation. A gene may be selected for inclusion in a panel by having a high frequency of mutation within a given gene. For instance, COSMIC indicates that 33% of a population of sequenced breast cancer samples have a mutation in TP53 and 22% of a population of sampled breast cancers have a mutation in KRAS. Other ranked genes, including APC, have mutations found only in about 4% of a population of sequenced breast cancer samples. TP53 and KRAS may be included in a sequencing panel based on having relatively high frequency among sampled breast cancers (compared to APC, for example, which occurs at a frequency of about 4%). COSMIC is provided as a non-limiting example, however, any database or set of information may be used that associates a cancer with tumor marker located in a gene or genetic region. In another example, as provided by COSMIC, of 1156 biliary tract cancer samples, 380 samples (33%) carried mutations in TP53. Several other genes, such as APC, have mutations in 4-8% of all samples. Thus, TP53 may be selected for inclusion in the panel based on a relatively high frequency in a population of biliary tract cancer samples.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0149">A gene or genomic section may be selected for a panel where the frequency of a tumor marker is significantly greater in sampled tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA than found in a given background population. A combination of genomic locations may be selected for inclusion of a panel such that at least a majority of subjects having a cancer may have a tumor marker or genomic region present in at least one of the genomic location or genes in the panel. The combination of genomic location may be selected based on data indicating that, for a particular cancer or set of cancers, a majority of subjects have one or more tumor markers in one or more of the selected regions. For example, to detect cancer 1, a panel comprising regions A, B, C, and/or D may be selected based on data indicating that 90% of subjects with cancer 1 have a tumor marker in regions A, B, C, and/or D of the panel. Alternately, tumor markers may be shown to occur independently in two or more regions in subjects having a cancer such that, combined, a tumor marker in the two or more regions is present in a majority of a population of subjects having a cancer. For example, to detect cancer 2, a panel comprising regions X, Y, and Z may be selected based on data indicating that 90% of subjects have a tumor marker in one or more regions, and in 30% of such subjects a tumor marker is detected only in region X, while tumor markers are detected only in regions Y and/or Z for the remainder of the subjects for whom a tumor marker was detected. Tumor markers present in one or more genomic locations previously shown to be associated with one or more cancers may be indicative of or predictive of a subject having cancer if a tumor marker is detected in one or more of those regions 50% or more of the time. Computational approaches such as models employing conditional probabilities of detecting cancer given a cancer frequency for a set of tumor markers within one or more regions may be used to predict which regions, alone or in combination, may be predictive of cancer. Other approaches for panel selection involve the use of databases describing information from studies employing comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors with large panels and/or whole genome sequencing (WGS, RNA-seq, Chip-seq, bisulfate sequencing, ATAC-seq, and others). Information gleaned from literature may also describe pathways commonly affected and mutated in certain cancers. Panel selection may be further informed by the use of ontologies describing genetic information.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0157">The panel selected herein can allow for deep sequencing that is sufficient to detect low-frequency genetic variants (e.g., in cell-free nucleic acid molecules obtained from a sample). An amount of genetic variants in a sample may be referred to in terms of the mutant allele frequency for a given genetic variant. The mutant allele frequency may refer to the frequency at which mutant alleles (e.g., not the most common allele) occurs in a given population of nucleic acids, such as a sample.

<p id="p-0184" num="0000">A maximum MAF may be determined as the maximum or largest MAF of all somatic variants present or observed in a given sample. In some embodiments, maximum MAF can be considered as tumor fraction of a given sample.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0176">A maximum fraction of diploid genes (&#x201c;max frac_diploid&#x201d;) (least allele imbalance) may be determined. A fraction of diploid genes (&#x201c;frac_diploid) is a measure of the level of allele imbalance across the sample as determined by copy number. Samples with high levels of allele imbalance are prone to germline/somatic misclassification. Therefore, a low level of allele imbalance (or high frac_diploid) is an indication of the reliability of the somatic classification call.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0177">In an embodiment, a total coverage profile may be used to capture fold change and thus tumor fraction, rather than individual genes.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0178">d. Variant Classification</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0179">Sequencing at steps <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> generates a plurality of sequence reads. The plurality of sequence reads may be analyzed to determine one or more variants and to classify the one or more variants at steps <b>107</b> and/or <b>108</b>. In an embodiment, some or all variant classification may be determined prior to MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, after MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, during MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, or combinations thereof. Variants may include, for example, single nucleotide variants (SNV's), indels, fusions, and copy number variation. Any known technique for variant calling may be used. In an embodiment, the plurality of sequence reads from a sample may be assembled and/or mapped and aligned to genomic positions relative to a reference genome. In some embodiments, the plurality of sequence reads (assembled or otherwise) may then be compared to the reference genome to determine how the plurality of sequence reads of the subject vary from that of the reference genome. Such a process may determine the presence of one or more variants in the plurality of sequence reads. In some embodiments, the molecular barcodes and/or start and stop genomic positions of a nucleic acid molecule obtained from the plurality of sequence reads can be used to identify the mutant molecules where the sequence reads belonging to the molecule differ from the reference genome. Such a process may determine the presence of one or more variants in the plurality of sequence reads.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0180">In an embodiment, common heterozygous SNPs may be used to model local germline allele count behavior and call variants somatic if they deviate significantly from observed germline mutant allele fraction. A betabinomial model may be used as it models both the mean and variance of mutant allele counts at common SNPs. For example, the betabinomial model described in PCT/US2018/052087, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, can be used. This is an improvement over simpler methods like fixed MAF cutoffs or Poisson models as they may not represent the variance in molecule counts appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0181">e. Variant Filtering</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0182">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or more filtering processes may be applied at step <b>109</b> to the sequence reads to exclude sequence reads from further analysis. In an embodiment, some or all filtering may be applied prior to MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, after MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, during MAF determination <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, before variant classification <b>107</b>/<b>108</b>, after variant classification <b>107</b>/<b>108</b>, during variant classification <b>107</b>/<b>108</b>, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0183">In some embodiments, one or more somatic variants having MAFs that are less than about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, or 0.9% at the first and/or second time points may be excluded from further analysis. In some embodiments, one or more somatic variants having less than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mutant molecule counts at the first and/or second time points may be excluded from further analysis. In some embodiments, one or more somatic variants having a coverage less than 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 at the first and/or second time points may be excluded from further analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0184">In an embodiment, copy number variants may be used to exclude sequence reads from further analysis. Copy number amplifications may be determined as is known in the art. At step <b>109</b>, the method <b>100</b> may filter out copy number amplifications in genes with either insufficient probe coverage or insufficient copy number (e.g. below the 95% limit of detection).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0185">By way of example, CNVs may be determined by analyzing sequence reads to generate a chromosomal region of coverage. The chromosomal regions may be divided into variable length windows or bins. Read coverage may be determined for each window/bin region. In an embodiment, a quantitative measure related to sequencing read coverage is a measure indicative of the number of reads derived from a DNA molecule corresponding to a genetic locus (e.g., a particular position, base, region, gene or chromosome from a reference genome). In order to associate reads to a genetic locus, the reads can be mapped or aligned to the reference. Software to perform mapping or aligning (e.g., Bowtie, BWA, mrsFAST, BLAST, BLAT) can associate a sequencing read with a genetic locus. After the sequence read coverage has been determined, a stochastic modeling algorithm may be applied to convert the normalized nucleic acid sequence read coverage for each window/bin region to the discrete copy number states. In some cases, this algorithm may comprise one or more of the following: Hidden Markov Model, dynamic programming, support vector machine, Bayesian network, trellis decoding, Viterbi decoding, expectation maximization, Kalman filtering methodologies and neural networks. The discrete copy number states of each window region can be utilized to identify copy number variation in the chromosomal regions. In some cases, all adjacent window/bin regions with the same copy number can be merged into a segment to report the presence or absence of copy number variation state. In some cases, various windows/bins can be filtered before they are merged with other segments. Copy number variation may be used to report a percentage score indicating how much disease material (or nucleic acids having a copy number variation) exists in a cell free polynucleotide sample.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0186">In an embodiment, the existence of CNVs in one or more genes may be used to exclude variants from further analysis. By way of example, variants having a threshold number of LDT-reportable genes with copy number &#x3e;=a gene-specific 95% limit of detection (LoD) in either T<sub>0 </sub>or T<sub>1 </sub>sample. The threshold may be from about 10 to about 30. The threshold may be, for example, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, etc. In an embodiment, the threshold may be 19.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0187">Copy number variation may indicate fold change for a given variant. A Gaussian model may be used to determine a ratio of fold changes between time T<sub>0 </sub>and time T<sub>1 </sub>which may be used as an estimate of molecular response score.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0188">In an embodiment, in the event the subject has no somatic variants, or has no variants that satisfy criteria of the variant filtering process, the subject may be classified as not-evaluable. In an embodiment, a subject classified as non-evaluable may be further classified as a molecular responder. In an embodiment, a subject having low ctDNA at both time T<sub>0 </sub>and time T<sub>1 </sub>may be classified as non-evaluable and further classified as a molecular responder. In an embodiment, a subject having a low MAF at both time T<sub>0 </sub>and time T<sub>1 </sub>may be classified as non-evaluable and further classified as a molecular responder. In an embodiment, a subject having a low tumor fraction at both time T<sub>0 </sub>and time T<sub>1 </sub>may be classified as non-evaluable and further classified as a molecular responder. Low MAF or low tumor fraction may refer to an MAF or a tumor fraction below a limit of detection (e.g. below the 95% limit of detection), or below a limit of quantification. What constitutes low may depend on panel design, but for example, an MAF f 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3% may be considered low.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0189">i. Germline Filter</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0190">In an embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a germline filter <b>200</b> may be applied to the sequence reads. Some (e.g., less than all) or all steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be performed in any combination and in any order. Samples collected over the course of a subject's treatment (e.g., samples collected at time T<sub>0 </sub>and at time T<sub>1</sub>) may have differing levels of tumor shedding and allele imbalance, meaning that variant classification at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> may be prone to assign differing somatic classifications for the same variant in the same subject. Since the aim of molecular response is to track the somatic variants over the course of treatment, a classification discrepancy may be automatically resolved to properly remove germline variants from consideration by reclassifying variants. For example, a variant may be classified as somatic at time T<sub>0 </sub>and germline at time T<sub>1</sub>. For example, a variant may be classified as germline at time T<sub>0 </sub>and somatic at time T<sub>1</sub>. For example, a variant may be classified as germline at time T<sub>0 </sub>and not classified at time T<sub>1</sub>. For example, a variant may be classified as somatic at time T<sub>0 </sub>and not classified at time T<sub>1</sub>. The germline filter <b>200</b> is configured to resolve such discrepancies and reassign variant classification.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0191">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at step <b>201</b>, a determination may be made for at least one variant in the sequence reads as to whether the variant is a deleterious variant (e.g., a frameshift or nonsense mutation) in a tumor suppressing gene (TSG). For example, the variant may be compared to a database of known TSG's. If the variant is a deleterious variant in a TSG, the variant may be classified as somatic, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from germline to somatic).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0192">If the variant is not a deleterious variant in a TSG, the germline filter <b>200</b> may determine the maximum MAF of variants present in a sample and the maximum fraction of diploid genes for at least one variant in the sample at step <b>202</b>. If, at step <b>203</b>, the maximum fraction of diploid genes for a variant (in one of the at least two time points) indicates that the variant is somatic and the MAF for the variant (in one of the at least two time points) does not increase the maximum MAF, the variant may be classified as somatic, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from germline to somatic). If, at step <b>203</b>, the maximum fraction of diploid genes for a variant (in one of the at least two time points) indicates that the variant is germline and the MAF for the variant (in one of the at least two time points) would increase the maximum MAF, the variant may be classified as germline, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from somatic to germline).</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0193">If, at step <b>203</b>, the maximum fraction of diploid genes for the variant indicates that the variant is somatic and the MAF for the variant would increase the maximum MAF&#x2014;or&#x2014;if the maximum fraction of diploid genes for the variant indicates that the variant is germline and the MAF for the variant would not increase the maximum MAF, the germline filter <b>200</b>, at step <b>204</b>, may determine if the variant is classified as somatic in another patient sample at less than a threshold percentage (in one of the at least two time points). The threshold percentage may be at least about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, or 9%. If the variant is classified as somatic in another patient sample at less than the threshold percentage the variant may be classified as somatic, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from germline to somatic).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0194">If, at step <b>204</b>, the variant is not classified as somatic in another patient sample at &#x3c;5%, the germline filter <b>200</b> may, at step <b>205</b>, determine if the MAF for a variant (in one of the at least two time points) is larger than another MAF in the sample. For example, the germline filter <b>200</b> may determine if the MAF for the variant is at least about two times greater, three times greater, four times greater, five times greater, six times greater, seven times greater, eight times greater, nine times greater, or at least 10 times greater than one or more other MAFs in the same sample. The one or more other MAFs in the sample may be, for example, the next highest somatic MAF to the max MAF in the sample. If the MAF for the variant is larger than another MAF in the sample the variant may be classified as germline, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from somatic to germline).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0195">The germline filter <b>200</b> may, at step <b>205</b>, determine if the MAF for a variant (in one of the at least two time points) is larger than another MAF in another sample.

The one or more other MAFs in another sample may be, for example, the max MAF of the other sample. If the MAF for the variant is larger than another MAF in another sample the variant may be classified as germline, regardless of the classification result at step <b>107</b>/<b>108</b> (e.g., the classification will be changed from somatic to germline).</p>

<p id="p-0206" num="0197">Those variants classified as germline may be excluded from further analysis, including for example, MAF determination and/or MR scoring. In some embodiments, variants are classified as CHIP variants when those variants are classified as CHIP in at least one patient sample.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0198">ii. CHIP Filter</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0199">cfDNA can comprise an aggregate of cfDNA from any cell types including tumor, blood cell and the like. Clonal hematopoiesis of intermediate potential mutation (CHIP) may even be present in cfDNA. Common approaches for CHIP filtering leverages recurrent CHIP genes or hotspots curated by large public or internal cohort studies.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0200">However, these approaches do not address challenges in identifying random CHIP mutations in a plasma only approach. Residual unfiltered CHIP variants would bias the fractional change towards 1 (unchanged) and thus yield inaccurate subsequent molecular response prediction. To filter private CHIP variants (e.g., a variant that is CHIP but has not been documented ever or not often in previous databases of known CHIP variants), mutation measurement between two timepoints can be used to cluster variants of similar fractional change. When a patient receive treatment, progression or response will result in fractional somatic mutation while CHIP variant will remain stable. By clustering mutations into clones, random CHIP variants can be found in clones with enrichment of known CHIP list or in clones with stable fractional difference.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0201">Accordingly, provided herein is an improvement in CHIP filtering that leverages the observations between two timepoints (T<sub>0 </sub>and T<sub>1</sub>) to cluster genomic mutations in clones with differing fractional change. CHIP filtering may group/cluster events into clones to estimate % clone load change. The clustering procedure may start with each single event and then merge utilizing a novel clustering heuristic. Once the % clone load change is determined using all the events, each clone can be inspected based on composition of variants and % clone load change to determine if the variant is a CHIP clone.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0202">In one embodiment, the genomic mutations/variants are clustered utilizing a novel agglomerative hierarchical clustering heuristic. The heuristic quantifies the statistical dissimilarity between mutations/variants and clusters via a custom dissimilarity metric. A tunable stopping rule is utilized which continues agglomeration until a minimum (or maximum, depending upon the metric) allowable dissimilarity threshold is met. In one embodiment, the custom dissimilarity metric is a modification of the Bhattacharyya distance such that a numerical integration is performed with respect to the product (not subjected to a square root) of the scaled likelihoods of the mutations/variants and/or clusters that are under consideration to be merged at a given step of the clustering heuristic. The likelihoods are scaled to numerically integrate to 1 over the support of the integration. For SNVs and indels, the likelihood is calculated with respect to a Beta-Binomial model approximation of the observed count data that informs the MAF determination for the variants being clustered. The dispersion of the Beta-Binomial model is set via a tunable parameter. For CNVs, the likelihood is calculated with respect to a Gaussian model approximation of the observed fold change estimates of the mutations of interest, with the variability of Gaussian model also set via a tunable parameter. The agglomeration of mutations is conducted in a novel fashion such that, in some instances, clustering is performed via a tiered approach, in which a first set of mutations is clustered until the stopping rule is met and then a second set of mutations is introduced and further agglomerative steps are possibly performed according to the same dissimilarity metric and stopping rule. In some circumstances, a third set of mutations is introduced in a similar manner following the application of the clustering heuristic to the second set of mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0203">In an embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a CHIP filter <b>300</b> may estimate, at step <b>301</b>, a scaled likelihood function P<sub>i</sub>(R<sub>i</sub>) for each mutation/variant in a sample, where i=1, . . . , I<sub>mv </sub>is the index for each unique qualifying mutation/variants observed across the two time points for a given sample, assuming a total of I<sub>mv </sub>qualifying mutation/variants are observed. For ease of presentation, we denote the number of observed mutation/variant counts at time point 1 for the i<sup>th </sup>mutation/variant as m<sub>i:1</sub><sup>obs</sup>, and the total number of counts at the genomic location and at time point 1 as n<sub>i:1</sub><sup>obs</sup>. Similarly, define m<sub>i:2</sub><sup>obs </sup>and n<sub>i:2</sub><sup>obs</sup>, but for time point 2. Define &#x3bd;<sub>i:1</sub><sup>true </sup>and &#x3bd;<sub>i:2</sub><sup>true </sup>as the true mutation/variant allele fractions as time points 1 and 2, respectively. The heuristic is designed to estimate R<sub>i</sub>=&#x3bd;<sub>i:2</sub><sup>true</sup>/&#x3bd;<sub>i:1</sub><sup>true </sup>and then to cluster together mutations/variants with R<sub>i </sub>values that can be plausibly considered to be identical. One embodiment of the heuristic is as follows:</p>

In an embodiment, MAF values of all the somatic variants may be used. In an embodiment, MAF values of less than all the somatic variants may be used. As described at step <b>105</b>/<b>106</b>, MAFs may be determined for a plurality of somatic variants from sequence reads generated from targeted nucleic acids associated with one or more cancer types in samples obtained from the subject at T<sub>0 </sub>(e.g., pre-treatment) and T<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., on-treatment) to produce sets of first and second MAFs for somatic variants in the plurality of somatic variants.

The clustering may be performed by combining pairs of variants with overlapping MAF ratio distributions, or other clustering methods. The single selected cluster may be that which contains a known cancer driver variant, or absence of known clonal hematopoiesis variants. Cluster weights may also depend on the presence of a known cancer driver variant or the maximum VAF or number of variants in the cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0213">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, an MR score may be determined according to a method <b>610</b>. The method <b>610</b> may comprise determining a weighted mean of the first MAFs and a weighted mean of the second MAFs for a somatic variant in the plurality of somatic variants and a corresponding standard deviation for a weighted MAF ratio at step <b>601</b>.

<p id="p-0236" num="0214">Clusters may be weighted based on the strength of evidence. For example, the max-VAF may indicate which is the primary clone, the number of non-CHIP variants may weight the cluster with the stronger signal; the driver weight may increase weight or select the cluster that contains the driver for that particular cancer type or molecular subtype. The weighting applied may be, for example, applying a greater weight to variants known to be drivers in the specific cancer type or molecular subtype. In an embodiment, weights may be based on max-VAF (either sample), number of non-CHIP variants, and/or driver weight (tumor-type-specific; defined in configuration file). In another embodiment, the weighting applied may be, for example, weighting somatic variants equally.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0215">In an embodiment, classification as a molecular responder or a molecular non-responder may depend on the variant VAFs and variant weights. For example, if the MR score is the ratio of mean VAFs, then the higher VAF (i.e., more clonal variant) is likely to dominate. If the MR score uses variant weights, then the variant with the higher weight (e.g., driver variant) might dominate.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0216">The resulting weighted mean of the MAF ratios as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> or the ratio of the weighted means of the MAFs as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is the MR score for the subject. Such an MR score incorporates the variance of MAF into the molecular response calculation. This ensures molecular response scores include accurate variance, which contributes to drawing a correct conclusion from the molecular response. The MR score may be viewed as a &#x201c;numerically stable&#x201d; ratio of mean MAFs, which appropriately weights changes in MAF based on the precision in the MAF, and which is not susceptible to overconfident and incorrect results when MAFs are fluctuating near the limit of detection (LOD). The MR score may be compared to a threshold to determine if the subject is responding to treatment or not responding to treatment. The threshold may be and/or include, for example, from about 25% to about 75%. In some embodiments, weighting could be either based on VAF precision (e.g. position, hotspot region, coverage depth and the like) or prior knowledge of importance of that variant to the tumor (e.g. known driver or resistance mutation, or variant of uncertain (or unknown) significance).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0217">To provide a simple example to illustrate aspects of the problem that the MR scoring methods presented herein address, consider a subject with one variant detected, with an MAF of 0.3% at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), and an MAF 0.1% on treatment (T<sub>1</sub>), and a coverage at that variant position of 3000 molecules.

Some embodiments involve integrating multiple genomic data sources to estimate tumor fraction (instead of just relying on variant (e.g., SNV, Indel and Fusion) VAFs), coverage (e.g., copy number), off-target coverage, and/or methylation, among other genomic data sources.</p>

In some embodiments, the epigenetic signature comprises a cfNA fragment length, position, and/or endpoint density distribution. In some embodiments, the epigenetic signature comprises an epigenetic state or status exhibited by one or more epigenetic loci in a given targeted genomic region.

For example, the molecular response score may indicate that the subject is not responding to a first treatment and the subject may then be placed on a second treatment in place of, or in addition to, the first treatment.

<p id="p-0271" num="0237">Typically, the methods of determining molecular response scores include filtering out CHIP variants. For example, molecular response is typically measured by allele frequency of genomic alternations (e.g., small variants between two time points) to represent tumor fractional change. Given that cfDNA signal is an aggregation of signal from essentially any cell types, including tumor, blood cell, and the like, numerous studies have shown the presence of clonal hematopoiesis of intermediate potential (CHIP) variants in cfDNA samples. Common approaches for CHIP filtering frequently leverage recurrent CHIP genes or hotspots curated by various data sources. However, it is yet a challenge to identify random CHIP mutations with a plasma only approach. Residual unfiltered CHIP variants typically bias the fractional change towards 1 (unchanged) and thus yield inaccurate molecular response prediction or scores. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein use a model to leverage the observations between two time points to cluster genomic mutations in clones with separate fractional change. To group mutations, these approaches typically leverage the variant allele count and total count for a variant from the two time points and build a probability density function for tumor fraction change R as P(R).</p>

<p id="p-0273" num="0239">In other aspect, this disclosure provides methods of identifying and excluding germline variants, or otherwise resolving somatic classification discrepancies when determining molecular response scores. For example, one problem is that samples collected over the course of a patient's treatment course typically have differing levels of tumor shedding and allele imbalance, meaning that a somatic variant caller of a given bioinformatics pipeline will sometimes arrive at differing somatic classifications for the same variant in the same patient. Since an aim of molecular response determinations is to track the somatic variants over the course of treatment, any classification discrepancies should be resolved to properly remove germline variants from consideration.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">IV. Customized Therapies and Related Administrations</heading>
<p id="p-0283" num="0249">In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein relate to identifying and administering therapies to patients having a given disease, disorder or condition. Essentially any cancer therapy (e.g., surgical therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or the like) is included as part of these methods. In certain embodiments, the therapy administered to a subject may comprise at least one chemotherapy drug. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy drug may comprise alkylating agents (for example, but not limited to, Chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Cisplatin and Carboplatin), nitrosoureas (for example, but not limited to, Carmustine and Lomustine), anti-metabolites (for example, but not limited to, Fluorauracil, Methotrexate and Fludarabine), plant alkaloids and natural products (for example, but not limited to, Vincristine, Paclitaxel and Topotecan), anti-tumor antibiotics (for example, but not limited to, Bleomycin, Doxorubicin and Mitoxantrone), hormonal agents (for example, but not limited to, Prednisone, Dexamethasone, Tamoxifen and Leuprolide) and biological response modifiers (for example, but not limited to, Herceptin and Avastin, Erbitux and Rituxan). In some embodiments, the chemotherapy administered to a subject may comprise FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. In certain embodiments, a therapy may be administered to a subject that comprises at least one PARP inhibitor. In certain embodiments, the PARP inhibitor may include OLAPARIB, TALAZOPARIB, RUCAPARIB, NIRAPARIB (trade name ZEJULA), among others. Typically, therapies include at least one immunotherapy (or an immunotherapeutic agent). Immunotherapy refers generally to methods of enhancing an immune response against a given cancer type. In certain embodiments, immunotherapy refers to methods of enhancing a T cell response against a tumor or cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0250">In some embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agents targets an immune checkpoint molecule. Certain tumors are able to evade the immune system by co-opting an immune checkpoint pathway. Thus, targeting immune checkpoints has emerged as an effective approach for countering a tumor's ability to evade the immune system and activating anti-tumor immunity against certain cancers. Pardoll, Nature Reviews Cancer, 2012, 12:252-264.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0251">In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is an inhibitory molecule that reduces a signal involved in the T cell response to antigen. For example, CTLA4 is expressed on T cells and plays a role in downregulating T cell activation by binding to CD80 (aka B7.1) or CD86 (aka B7.2) on antigen presenting cells. PD-1 is another inhibitory checkpoint molecule that is expressed on T cells. PD-1 limits the activity of T cells in peripheral tissues during an inflammatory response. In addition, the ligand for PD-1 (PD-L1 or PD-L2) is commonly upregulated on the surface of many different tumors, resulting in the downregulation of anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is CTLA4 or PD-1. In other embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is a ligand for PD-1, such as PD-L1 or PD-L2. In other embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is a ligand for CTLA4, such as CD80 or CD86. In other embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor (KIR), T cell membrane protein 3 galectin 9 (GAL9), or adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR).</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0252">Antagonists that target these immune checkpoint molecules can be used to enhance antigen-specific T cell responses against certain cancers. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an antagonist of an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is PD-1. In certain embodiments, the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is PD-L1. In certain embodiments, the antagonist of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule is an antibody (e.g., a monoclonal antibody). In certain embodiments, the antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody. In certain embodiments, the monoclonal antibody is a combination of an anti-CTLA4 antibody and an anti-PD-1 antibody, an anti-CTLA4 antibody and an anti-PD-L1 antibody, or an anti-PD-L1 antibody and an anti-PD-1 antibody. In certain embodiments, the anti-PD-1 antibody is one or more of pembrolizumab (Keytruda&#xae;) or nivolumab (Opdivo&#xae;). In certain embodiments, the anti-CTLA4 antibody is ipilimumab (Yervoy&#xae;). In certain embodiments, the anti-PD-L1 antibody is one or more of atezolizumab (Tecentriq&#xae;), avelumab (Bavencio&#xae;), or durvalumab (Imfinzi&#xae;).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0253">In certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an antagonist (e.g. antibody) against CD80, CD86, LAG3, KIR, TIM3, GAL9, or A2aR. In other embodiments, the antagonist is a soluble version of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, such as a soluble fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and an Fc domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, the soluble fusion protein comprises the extracellular domain of CTLA4, PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2. In some embodiments, the soluble fusion protein comprises the extracellular domain of CD80, CD86, LAG3, KIR, TIM3, GALS, or A2aR. In one embodiment, the soluble fusion protein comprises the extracellular domain of PD-L2 or LAG3.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0254">In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a co-stimulatory molecule that amplifies a signal involved in a T cell response to an antigen. For example, CD28 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on T cells. When a T cell binds to antigen through its T cell receptor, CD28 binds to CD80 (aka B7.1) or CD86 (aka B7.2) on antigen-presenting cells to amplify T cell receptor signaling and promote T cell activation. Because CD28 binds to the same ligands (CD80 and CD86) as CTLA4, CTLA4 is able to counteract or regulate the co-stimulatory signaling mediated by CD28. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a co-stimulatory molecule selected from CD28, inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), CD137, OX40, or CD27. In other embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a ligand of a co-stimulatory molecule, including, for example, CD80, CD86, B7RP1, B7-H3, B7-H4, CD137L, OX40L, or CD70.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0255">Agonists that target these co-stimulatory checkpoint molecules can be used to enhance antigen-specific T cell responses against certain cancers. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the immunotherapy or immunotherapeutic agent is an agonist of a co-stimulatory checkpoint molecule. In certain embodiments, the agonist of the co-stimulatory checkpoint molecule is an agonist antibody and preferably is a monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, the agonist antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-CD28 antibody. In other embodiments, the agonist antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-ICOS, anti-CD137, anti-OX40, or anti-CD27 antibody. In other embodiments, the agonist antibody or monoclonal antibody is an anti-CD80, anti-CD86, anti-B7RP1, anti-B7-H3, anti-B7-H4, anti-CD137L, anti-OX40L, or anti-CD70 antibody.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">A. Example 1: Comparison of Molecular Response Calculations for Prediction of Patient Outcome</heading>
<p id="p-0305" num="0271">1. Background</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0272">Molecular response (MR) estimated as a change in circulating tumor (ctDNA) load between an early on treatment sample (usually 2-9 weeks post treatment start) and pre-treatment baseline has been shown to predict patient response and outcomes across solid tumors and therapy types in many retrospective studies. There is no consensus, however, regarding the best method for assessing molecular response. Therefore, we aimed to assess several molecular response calculations and determine the optimal method for predicting outcomes in individual advanced cancer patients.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0273">2. Method</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0274">Aggregate results of &#x3e;4,000 patient sample pairs (3-10 weeks apart), &#x3e;1000 patient sample technical replicates, &#x3e;100 contrived sample dilutions, and in silico simulations were analyzed using cfDNA NGS assay clinical platform (Guardant Health, Inc., Redwood City, Calif., USA). Baseline and on-treatment paired patient samples were collected from advanced cancer patients with over 12 tumor types, including lung, colon, and breast. MR calculations included variant allele fractions (VAFs) of somatic SNVs, indels and fusions. Methods were compared, including Ratio of Maximum VAF (RmaxVAF), Ratio of Mean VAF (RmVAF), and Mean of VAF Ratios (mVAF). Analytical accuracy, reproducibility and limit of detection (LoD) were assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0275">3. Results</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0276">Comparison of methods for calculating net change in ctDNA load on &#x3e;1500 sample pairs showed high correlation (p ranged from 0.93 to 0.98) and categorical agreement split by the median (93%). Therefore selecting an optimal method based on outcome prediction would require prohibitively large patient cohorts. Analytical evaluation and in silico simulations can predict the behavior of each method. Simulations of changes in tumor fraction of real pre-treatment samples found that RmVAF or RmaxVAF are more accurate than mVAFR, which can be skewed by low VAF ratios. Almost 25% of sample pairs have a tumor driver or resistance mutation that is not the maxVAF, suggesting tumor dynamics are better captured by mVAF than maxVAF. Newly-detected on-treatment variants can be an important signal of rising ctDNA levels, impacting MR in approximately 2% of sample pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0277">Importantly, MR accuracy for all methods decreases as maxVAF approaches or falls below the variant LoD, due to both stochastic detection and higher CV of variants at low VAF. Thus the assay variant LoD is a key determinant of the fraction of patients who can receive MR evaluation. Technical replicates identified the variant criteria at which a 50% change in tumor fraction differs significantly from technical variation, and could define analytical reporting limits.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0278">4. Conclusions</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0279">Comparison of MR methods in a large set of patient samples and simulations supports RmVAF with inclusion of newly-detected mutations.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">B. Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0314" num="0280">1. Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0281">Molecular response (MR) is an assessment of the change in circulating tumor (ctDNA) load early on-treatment (usually 3-10 weeks) in comparison to pre-treatment baseline. In many retrospective studies, molecular response was associated with patient response to therapy and long term outcomes across solid tumors and therapy types.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0282">Molecular response has also been shown to predict clinical response earlier than radiographic and/or RECIST response. Multiple methods have been used to calculate molecular response and there is no consensus regarding which method is best.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0283">In this example, several molecular response calculations were assessed and the optimal method for predicting outcomes in individual advanced cancer patients were determined.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0284">2. Methods</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0285">Paired samples from &#x3e;1,500 patient plasma samples spaced 3-10 weeks apart were processed using cfDNA NGS assay clinical platform (Guardant Health, Inc., Redwood City, Calif., USA), with median unique coverage of 4600 molecules sequenced to 20,000&#xd7; read depth. Somatic and germline SNVs, small indels, and fusions were subset to a 74-cancer associated gene panel space to mimic clinical applications of Molecular Response. &#x3e;140 patient sample technical replicates were processed on either panel and subsetted to the 74-gene panel space. Three previously published molecular response methods were assessed (see Table 3).</p>

<p id="p-0328" num="0292">iii. Variants are Included in Molecular Response Calculation Based on Detection and VAF Precision</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0293"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows an example of variant precision is determined by Mutant Molecule Count (MMC=VAF*Molecular Coverage). (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>) Variants have a range of molecular coverage, depending on sample input and panel design. Probability of variant detection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>) and VAF precision (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref>) depends on both VAF and molecular coverage (colors, mapping to (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>)). MMC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>D</figref>) is a better metric for variant precision, because it determines the probability of variant detection (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>E</figref>) and VAF precision (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>F</figref>). Variants with low MMC at both timepoints should be excluded from molecular response to better clarify signal from noise.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0294">iv. Molecular Response is Largely Consistent Between Methods but R(mVAF) is More Robust Across Patients</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows that tumor signal can be outweighed by a minority of variants when using Mean of ratios, m(rVAF), or ratio of max, R(maxVAF). (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>) MR score is categorized as Increasing, Decreasing or within precision limit (&#x201c;Near 0% Change&#x201d;). Only 8% of patients change between Increasing and Decreasing in any method, showing high categorical correlation (X2 p&#x3c;0.001). MR correlation ranges from p=0.42 to 0.86 (p&#x3c;0.001). (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>) m(rVAF) is prone to overestimating MR when some VAFs are low (red). R(maxVAF) can be skewed by a single maximum variant (purple) deviating from the majority. 20% of sample pairs have a tumor driver or resistance mutation that is not the maxVAF, suggesting tumor dynamics are better captured by mVAF. (C) Excluding new on-treatment variants would result in a lower MR evaluable rate and excludes signal of emerging variants.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0296">v. Patients with Low Signal of ctDNA Level Change are Identified as not Evaluable for Molecular Response</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows an example that certainty in molecular response score increases with increasing number of variants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>), molecular coverage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>), and maximum VAF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0298">Sample pairs are not evaluable for molecular response using VAF-based methods if there are no somatic variants (approx. 7% of patients), or no somatic variants meeting inclusion criteria (16%). In addition, certainty in molecular response score is calculated theoretically using statistical model of VAF precision. Sample pairs exceeding the acceptable limit of uncertainty (black line) are not evaluable for MR (3%). This results in approx 74% of sample pairs evaluable for MR.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0299">vi. Range of Molecular Response Scores in Clinical Patient Samples Reflect Strong Biological Signal</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0300">In clinical patient sample pairs, molecular response distribution shows a range of scores from 100% Decrease to &#x3e;100% Increase (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0301">Technical replicates provide null molecular response distribution peaked at 0% change (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0302">4. Conclusions</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0303">Each component of molecular response calculation is important for accurate assessment of MR, including germline and low-precision variant filtering, overall formulation, and evaluable criteria. Comparison of molecular response methods in a large set of patient samples and simulations supports ratio of mean VAF with inclusion of newly-detected mutations.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">C. Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0340" num="0304"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> shows example of a sample pair for MR calculation. Starting with all SNVs, Indels, Fusions detected in either sample, common germline variants are removed. Next, variant somatic/germline classification discrepancies are resolved to give a single classification. (In this example, there were no discrepancies). Next, germline variants are filtered out, and then CHIP variants are filtered out (in this example, ATM.R3008H is a CHIP variant that is removed). Next, variants that do not meet the MMC- or coverage-based inclusion thresholds are removed. In this example, after these filtering steps, three somatic variants (PDGFRA, RET and TP53) remain. Finally, the MR score is calculated from these remaining variants. In this example, the baseline mean VAF is 22.2%, and the on-treatment mean VAF is 2.7%, giving an MR score of 12%, which is a ctDNA Decrease of 88%.</p>
