<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a coating intended for the protection, against molten metal corrosion, of stainless steel used as parts in the hot-dip coating process of steel strips. The present invention also relates to the method for the manufacture of the coated stainless steel thereof and to the process of hot dip coating with recourse to the coated stainless steel thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Usually, in the steel route production, steel strips are coated with a metallic coating deposited by hot-dip coating, i.e. hot-dip galvanizing or hot-dip aluminizing. This metallic coating contains elements typically selected notably among Zinc, Aluminium, Silicon, and Magnesium. These elements are melted in a bath through which the steel strip runs. To do so, some metallic devices or parts, such as the snout, the sink roll, the stabilizing rolls, pipelines or pumping elements are in direct contact with the molten bath.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During such contact, a reaction takes place between the molten metal and the immersed part. In particular, Zn and/or Al form intermetallic compounds with the iron of the metallic device, which results in an embrittlement of the immersed part. To limit this corrosion induced by the molten metal, the metallic devices or parts to be used in contact with the molten metal are usually made of stainless steel. Despite the improvement of the resistance to molten metal corrosion, the stainless steel in contact with the molten metal keeps corroding, which leads to deformations, embrittlements and breakdowns. For example, the lower part of a snout made of stainless steel can be immerged during months in a molten bath. During this immersion, the molten metal attacks the snout, which results in a thinner snout wall thickness which together with high temperature condition causes the cracking of the tool. Because of the molten metal corrosion, the snout must often be inspected, maintained and replaced. These regular inspections, maintenances and replacements are done at the expense of line stops, which seriously impair the production of hot-dip coated steel strips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The patent application CN201172680 discloses a snout for a cold-rolled steel strip galvanization bath including an upper and a lower frames, the upper frame being made of welded stainless steel plates and the lower frame being made of an aluminum oxide ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nevertheless, this snout comprising two parts made of two materials, i.e. stainless steel and aluminum oxide ceramic, is difficult to produce. Indeed, the aluminum oxide ceramic is casted to form the lower part of the snout. The melting point of the aluminum oxide is very high, around 2000&#xb0; C. Thus, new equipment are needed to produce such part, which significantly impact the cost of such snout.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a stainless steel substrate well protected against molten metal corrosion so that inspections, maintenances and replacements are limited and so that embrittlement, deformation and breakdowns are further prevented. Moreover, a further alternate or additional object of the invention is to provide an easy-to-implement method for producing this stainless steel substrate without replacing the current equipment in the hot-dip galvanizing lines and hot-dip aluminizing lines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a coated stainless-steel substrate comprising a coating comprising nanographites and a binder being sodium silicate, wherein the stainless-steel substrate has the following composition in weight percent:

        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0054">Graphite nanoplatelet is a synonym of nanographite.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0055">Substrate refers to a material which provides the surface on which something is deposited. This material is not limited in terms of size, dimensions and shapes. It can notably be in the form of a strip, a sheet, a piece, a part, an element, a device, an equipment. . . . It can be flat or shaped by any means.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0056">&#x201c;coated&#x201d; means that the substrate is at least locally covered with the coating. The covering can be for example limited to the area of the substrate to be immersed in the molten metal bath. &#x201c;coated&#x201d; inclusively includes &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; (no intermediate materials, elements or space disposed therebetween) and &#x201c;indirectly on&#x201d; (intermediate materials, elements or space disposed therebetween). For example, coating the substrate can include applying the coating directly on the substrate with no intermediate materials/elements therebetween, as well as applying the coating indirectly on the substrate with one or more intermediate materials/elements therebetween.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0057">Hot-dip coating process refers to the process of hot-dip galvanizing, when the coating is zinc-based, and to the process of hot-dip aluminizing, when the coating is aluminium-based.</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0058">Without willing to be bound by any theory, it seems that a coating comprising nanographites and a binder being sodium silicate on the stainless-steel substrate acts like a barrier to molten metal attack and prevents the formation of Zn&#x2014;Fe and/or Al&#x2014;Fe intermetallic compounds. Indeed, the coating according to the present invention is non-wetting with regard to the elements of the molten metal bath due to its graphitic content. In particular, it seems that nanographites are not wetted by liquid Zinc and/or Aluminium. The nanographites thus act as the non-wetting agent while sodium silicate acts as binder and adhesion promoter to the stainless steel surface. The non-adhesion of the molten metal elements to the stainless-steel surface leads to an increase of the corrosion resistance, a decrease of the deformation risk of the substrate and a longer lifetime of the substrate. Moreover, the coating comprising sodium silicate well adheres on the stainless-steel substrate so that the stainless-steel substrate is even more protected. It further prevents the risk of coating cracks and coating detachment, which would expose the stainless-steel substrate to molten metal attack and deformation.</p>

This sodium silicate reacts during the drying phase so as to form rigid siloxane chains. It is believed that the siloxane chains get attached to the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the stainless steel substrate. It is also believed that the sodium silicate dissolved in the aqueous mixture applied on the substrate will penetrate in all the crevices from the substrate surface and, after drying, will become tough and vitreous therefore anchoring the coating to the substrate.</p>
