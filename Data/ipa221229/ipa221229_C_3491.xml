<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is generally related to the field of plant molecular biology, and in particular embodiments, to the field of detecting a chromosomal translocation within plants. In certain aspects, the chromosomal translocation occurs between the N7 and N16 chromosomes of <i>Brassica napus</i>. In other aspects, the chromosomal translocation is a homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. Accordingly, this disclosure provides compositions and methods for the identification, detection and utilization of such a chromosomal translocation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><i>Brassica napus </i>(canola) is one of the major economic crops grown worldwide as a primary source of vegetable oil. Growing demand for diets with healthy oil has increased <i>B. napus </i>importance as a food. <i>B. napus </i>is one of the lowest-cost sources of vegetable oil. <i>B. napus </i>oil accounts for a large proportion of edible oil consumed worldwide. It is used as a liquid oil, in baking, frying, salad dressing, margarine, and a multitude of processed foods. <i>B. napus </i>is agronomically well-adapted to many parts of the world and production continues to expand from year to year. The low cost and ready availability of <i>B. napus </i>oil provides an excellent opportunity to upgrade this commodity oil into higher value specialty oils that add value to the farmer. The development of new and improved lines of <i>B. napus </i>remains a continual challenge for breeders.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><i>B. napus </i>is a recently formed allo-tetraploid species that contains two closely related homologous sub-genome types, named A and C. Although a tetraploid, canola behaves genetically as a diploid, due to strict control on the meiotic chromosome pairing that prevent recombination between highly similar homologous chromosomes. However, &#x201c;de novo&#x201d; recombination can occur between A and C genomes at low frequency in &#x2018;natural&#x2019; polyploids of canola (unlike re-synthesized canola, where these events occur at a higher frequency), leading to a variety of large homologous chromosomal structural rearrangements (HCR). Few historical HCR are artificially selected and fixed in the canola germplasm inadvertently due to their linkage with traits of commercial importance. One class of HCR is reciprocal translocation (homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation), where homologous recombination result in reciprocal swapping of parts of the A and C chromosomes without loss of any genetic material. Progenies derived from crosses between <i>B. napus </i>plants differing for the presence or absence of an homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation can be classified into two groups. Those with &#x2018;parental type&#x2019; chromosomal constitution with no apparent loss or gain of genetic material, and those with &#x2018;non-parental recombinant type&#x2019; chromosomal constitution that result in duplication or deletion of genetic material. The second, will result in complex non-mendelian segregation patterns. Few &#x2018;fixed&#x2019; homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocations have been identified and reported in the literature for <i>B. napus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Molecular breeding assays that can be utilized for breeding new lines of <i>B. napus </i>are desirable. For example, assays that can be used to detect and monitor homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocations within <i>B. napus </i>are of particular importance. Therefore, there is an important need in the art to continue to identify novel methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can be readily applied for breeding in <i>B. napus. </i></p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Development of novel methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can be readily applied for breeding in <i>B. napus </i>are of importance for <i>B. napus </i>breeders. Commercially viable assays that are time efficient and can provide cost saving are of particular interest. Of further importance is the ability to complete the assay in a variety of different scales. From a single Eppendorf&#x2122; tube to larger multi-well formats, the application of the assay should be readily utilized in any applied format. Methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>are disclosed herein. A detailed genomic characterization of the break point, the genetic/physical extent of this homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation, frequency in the global elite germplasm &#x26; distribution in various heterotic pools, and linkage with traits of commercial value are provided for the first time in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>of the subject disclosure provide markable improvements over the low throughput, low resolution and expensive methods (e.g., Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), and use of low-density molecular marker systems such as RFLP and SSR, and other known methods) that are generally available for routing breeding. The presence of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>in breeding progenies results in non-parental recombinant types, characterized by segmental deletion and duplication in homologous regions. The methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>provide numerous advantages to overcome particular problems for <i>B. napus </i>breeding.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A particular problem for <i>B. napus </i>breeders is the development of an assay to detect the introgression of traits in <i>B. napus </i>breeding programs. Traits that are bred into proximity of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>can be introduced into new lines of <i>B. napus </i>germplasm through the translocation of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal. Either native traits or transgenic traits may be bred into loci within the chromosomal regions of either the N7 or N16 chromosome. Relying upon the translocation mechanism within specific lines of <i>B. napus </i>allows for the introgression of the trait into a new line of <i>B. napus</i>. As such, the methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>provide a solution for introgressing traits within <i>B. napus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A particular problem for <i>B. napus </i>breeders is the development of an assay to detect heterosis in <i>B. napus </i>breeding programs. The identification of &#x201c;parental type&#x201d; classes of <i>B. napus </i>lines among the breeding progenies that have been identified to segregate for N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>have heterotic advantage. Currently, there is no ability to detect and enrich/discard these variants leading to loss of cost and time efficiencies in breeding. As such, the methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>provide a solution for detecting heterosis within <i>B. napus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A particular problem for <i>B. napus </i>breeders is the development of an assay for signal detection in <i>B. napus </i>breeding programs. Typical commercial scale &#x201c;signal detection&#x201d; methods rely on a single reference genetic map and marker order, by-passing the construction of de novo population specific genetic map for signal detection. If a large homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation, such as N7/N16, are differentially distributed/fixed in the heterotic pools, and the mapping populations are segregating for N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation, then such signal detection assays could lead to inaccurate assignments of quantitative trait loci and genes present on these chromosomes, directly impacting marker driven forward and backcross breeding selections. As such, the methods and compositions for molecular breeding assays that can detect a N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>provide a solution for detecting the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation within <i>B. napus. </i></p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to further clarify this disclosure, the following terms, abbreviations and definitions are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;has&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d;, &#x201c;contains&#x201d;,&#x201d; or &#x201c;containing&#x201d;, or any other variation thereof, are intended to be non-exclusive or open-ended. For example, a composition, a mixture, a process, a method, an article, or an apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture, process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, &#x201c;or&#x201d; refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; preceding an element or component of an embodiment of the disclosure are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances, i.e., occurrences of the element or component. Therefore &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;invention&#x201d; or &#x201c;present invention&#x201d; as used herein is a non-limiting term and is not intended to refer to any single embodiment of the particular invention but encompasses all possible embodiments as disclosed in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">&#x201c;Amplification&#x201d; is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (i.e., replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (i.e., synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template specificity is frequently described in terms of &#x201c;target&#x201d; specificity. Target sequences are &#x201c;targets&#x201d; in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques were designed primarily for this sorting out.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polymerase chain reaction&#x201d; and &#x201c;PCR&#x201d; generally refers to the method for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,965,188; herein incorporated by reference). This process for amplifying the target sequence comprises introducing an excess of two oligonucleotide primers to the DNA mixture containing the desired target sequence, followed by a precise sequence of thermal cycling in the presence of a DNA polymerase. The two primers are complementary to their respective strands of the double stranded target sequence. To effect amplification, the mixture is denatured and the primers then annealed to their complementary sequences within the target molecule. Following annealing, the primers are extended with a polymerase so as to form a new pair of complementary strands. The steps of denaturation, primer annealing and polymerase extension can be repeated many times (i.e., denaturation, annealing and extension constitute one &#x201c;cycle&#x201d;; there can be numerous &#x201c;cycles&#x201d;) to obtain a high concentration of an amplified segment of the desired target sequence. The length of the amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of the primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the &#x201c;polymerase chain reaction&#x201d; (hereinafter &#x201c;PCR&#x201d;). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be &#x201c;PCR amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Term &#x201c;amplicon&#x201d; refers to as natural or manually amplification event (for example, polymerase chain reaction) product formation Polynucleotides (for example, DNA) segment. In some embodiments, amplicon &#x201c;length&#x201d; amplicon, and the length is at least 5 kb, or At least 6 kb, 7 kb, 8 kb, 9 kb, 10 kb, 11 kb, 12 kb, 13 kb, 14 kb, 15 kb, 16 kb, 17 kb, 18 kb, 1.9 kb, or 20 kb.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d;, as used herein means having been removed from its natural environment, or removed from other compounds present when the compound is first formed. The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; embraces materials isolated from natural sources as well as materials (e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) recovered after preparation by recombinant expression in a host cell, or chemically-synthesized compounds such as nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d;, as used herein relates to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment, or substantially enriched in concentration relative to other compounds present when the compound is first formed, and means having been increased in purity as a result of being separated from other components of the original composition. The term &#x201c;purified nucleic acid&#x201d; is used herein to describe a nucleic acid sequence which has been separated, produced apart from, or purified away from other biological compounds including, but not limited to polypeptides, lipids and carbohydrates, while effecting a chemical or functional change in the component (e.g., a nucleic acid may be purified from a chromosome by removing protein contaminants and breaking chemical bonds connecting the nucleic acid to the remaining DNA in the chromosome).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The term &#x201c;synthetic&#x201d;, as used herein refers to a polynucleotide (i.e., a DNA or RNA) molecule that was created via chemical synthesis as an in vitro process. For example, a synthetic DNA may be created during a reaction within an Eppendorf&#x2122; tube, such that the synthetic DNA is enzymatically produced from a native strand of DNA or RNA. Other laboratory methods may be utilized to synthesize a polynucleotide sequence. Oligonucleotides may be chemically synthesized on an oligo synthesizer via solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidites. The synthesized oligonucleotides may be annealed to one another as a complex, thereby producing a &#x201c;synthetic&#x201d; polynucleotide. Other methods for chemically synthesizing a polynucleotide are known in the art, and can be readily implemented for use in the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein means greater or lesser than the value or range of values stated by 10 percent, but is not intended to designate any value or range of values to only this broader definition. Each value or range of values preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For the purposes of the present disclosure, a &#x201c;gene,&#x201d; includes a DNA region encoding a gene product (see infra), as well as all DNA regions which regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites, introns and locus control regions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As used herein the terms &#x201c;native&#x201d; or &#x201c;natural&#x201d; define a condition found in nature. A &#x201c;native DNA sequence&#x201d; is a DNA sequence present in nature that was produced by natural means or traditional breeding techniques but not generated by genetic engineering (e.g., using molecular biology/transformation techniques).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein a &#x201c;transgene&#x201d; is defined to be a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product, including for example, but not limited to, an mRNA. In one embodiment the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an exogenous nucleic acid, where the transgene/heterologous coding sequence has been introduced into a host cell by genetic engineering (or the progeny thereof) where the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is not normally found. In one example, a transgene/heterologous coding sequence encodes an industrially or pharmaceutically useful compound, or a gene encoding a desirable agricultural trait (e.g., an herbicide-resistance gene). In yet another example, a transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an antisense nucleic acid sequence, wherein expression of the antisense nucleic acid sequence inhibits expression of a target nucleic acid sequence. In one embodiment the transgene/heterologous coding sequence is an endogenous nucleic acid, wherein additional genomic copies of the endogenous nucleic acid are desired, or a nucleic acid that is in the antisense orientation with respect to the sequence of a target nucleic acid in a host organism.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A &#x201c;gene product&#x201d; as defined herein is any product produced by the gene. For example, the gene product can be the direct transcriptional product of a gene (e.g., mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, antisense RNA, interfering RNA, ribozyme, structural RNA or any other type of RNA) or a protein produced by translation of a mRNA. Gene products also include RNAs which are modified, by processes such as capping, polyadenylation, methylation, and editing, and proteins modified by, for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, myristilation, and glycosylation. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals, for example, exposure of a cell, tissue, or organism to an agent that increases or decreases gene expression. Expression of a gene can also be regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation of gene expression occurs, for example, through controls acting on transcription, translation, RNA transport and processing, degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through activation, inactivation, compartmentalization, or degradation of specific protein molecules after they have been made, or by combinations thereof. Gene expression can be measured at the RNA level or the protein level by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, or in vitro, in situ, or in vivo protein activity assay(s).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein the term &#x201c;gene expression&#x201d; relates to the process by which the coded information of a nucleic acid transcriptional unit (including, e.g., genomic DNA) is converted into an operational, non-operational, or structural part of a cell, often including the synthesis of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by external signals; for example, exposure of a cell, tissue, or organism to an agent that increases or decreases gene expression. Expression of a gene can also be regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation of gene expression occurs, for example, through controls acting on transcription, translation, RNA transport and processing, degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through activation, inactivation, compartmentalization, or degradation of specific protein molecules after they have been made, or by combinations thereof. Gene expression can be measured at the RNA level or the protein level by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, or in vitro, in situ, or in vivo protein activity assay(s).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, the term &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; (or &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d;) may refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides, which may include both sense and anti-sense strands of RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic forms and mixed polymers of the above. A nucleotide may refer to a ribonucleotide, deoxyribonucleotide, or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. A &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; as used herein is synonymous with &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; and &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d;. A nucleic acid molecule is usually at least 10 bases in length, unless otherwise specified. The term may refer to a molecule of RNA or DNA of indeterminate length. The term includes single- and double-stranded forms of DNA. A nucleic acid molecule may include either or both naturally-occurring and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring and/or non-naturally occurring nucleotide linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Nucleic acid molecules may be modified chemically or biochemically, or may contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases, as will be readily appreciated by those of skill in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications (e.g., uncharged linkages: for example, methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidites, carbamates, etc.; charged linkages: for example, phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.; pendent moieties: for example, peptides; intercalators: for example, acridine, psoralen, etc.; chelators; alkylators; and modified linkages: for example, alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.). The term &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; also includes any topological conformation, including single-stranded, double-stranded, partially duplexed, triplexed, hairpinned, circular, and padlocked conformations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Transcription proceeds in a 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; manner along a DNA strand. This means that RNA is made by the sequential addition of ribonucleotide-5&#x2032;-triphosphates to the 3&#x2032; terminus of the growing chain (with a requisite elimination of the pyrophosphate). In either a linear or circular nucleic acid molecule, discrete elements (e.g., particular nucleotide sequences) may be referred to as being &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; or &#x201c;5&#x2032;&#x201d; relative to a further element if they are bonded or would be bonded to the same nucleic acid in the 5&#x2032; direction from that element. Similarly, discrete elements may be &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; or &#x201c;3&#x2032;&#x201d; relative to a further element if they are or would be bonded to the same nucleic acid in the 3&#x2032; direction from that element.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A base &#x201c;position&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the location of a given base or nucleotide residue within a designated nucleic acid. The designated nucleic acid may be defined by alignment (see below) with a reference nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Hybridization relates to the binding of two polynucleotide strands via Hydrogen bonds. Oligonucleotides and their analogs hybridize by hydrogen bonding, which includes Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary bases. Generally, nucleic acid molecules consist of nitrogenous bases that are either pyrimidines (cytosine (C), uracil (U), and thymine (T)) or purines (adenine (A) and guanine (G)). These nitrogenous bases form hydrogen bonds between a pyrimidine and a purine, and the bonding of the pyrimidine to the purine is referred to as &#x201c;base pairing.&#x201d; More specifically, A will hydrogen bond to T or U, and G will bond to C. &#x201c;Complementary&#x201d; refers to the base pairing that occurs between two distinct nucleic acid sequences or two distinct regions of the same nucleic acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">&#x201c;Specifically hybridizable&#x201d; and &#x201c;specifically complementary&#x201d; are terms that indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target. The oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA, and there is sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions where specific binding is desired, for example under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or systems. Such binding is referred to as specific hybridization.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hybridization conditions resulting in particular degrees of stringency will vary depending upon the nature of the chosen hybridization method and the composition and length of the hybridizing nucleic acid sequences. Generally, the temperature of hybridization and the ionic strength (especially the Na+ and/or Mg2+ concentration) of the hybridization buffer will contribute to the stringency of hybridization, though wash times also influence stringency. Calculations regarding hybridization conditions required for attaining particular degrees of stringency are discussed in Sambrook et al. (ed.), <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>2nd ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989, chs. 9 and 11.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, &#x201c;stringent conditions&#x201d; encompass conditions under which hybridization will only occur if there is less than 50% mismatch between the hybridization molecule and the DNA target. &#x201c;Stringent conditions&#x201d; include further particular levels of stringency. Thus, as used herein, &#x201c;moderate stringency&#x201d; conditions are those under which molecules with more than 50% sequence mismatch will not hybridize; conditions of &#x201c;high stringency&#x201d; are those under which sequences with more than 20% mismatch will not hybridize; and conditions of &#x201c;very high stringency&#x201d; are those under which sequences with more than 10% mismatch will not hybridize.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In particular embodiments, stringent conditions can include hybridization at 65&#xb0; C., followed by washes at 65&#xb0; C. with 0.1&#xd7;SSC/0.1% SDS for 40 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The following are representative, non-limiting hybridization conditions: Very High Stringency: Hybridization in 5&#xd7;SSC buffer at 65&#xb0; C. for 16 hours; was twice in 2&#xd7;SSC buffer at room temperature for 15 minutes each; and wash twice in 0.5&#xd7;SSC buffer at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes each. High Stringency: Hybridization in 5&#xd7;-6&#xd7;SSC buffer at 65-70&#xb0; C. for 16-20 hours; wash twice in 2&#xd7;SSC buffer at room temperature for 5-20 minutes each; and wash twice in 1&#xd7;SSC buffer at 55-70&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes each. Moderate Stringency: Hybridization in 6&#xd7;SSC buffer at room temperature to 55&#xb0; C. for 16-20 hours; wash at least twice in 2&#xd7;-3&#xd7;SSC buffer at room temperature to 55&#xb0; C. for 20-30 minutes each.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In particular embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under very high stringency hybridization conditions. In these and further embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under high stringency hybridization conditions. In these and further embodiments, specifically hybridizable nucleic acid molecules can remain bound under moderate stringency hybridization conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, the term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; refers to a short nucleic acid polymer. Oligonucleotides may be formed by cleavage of longer nucleic acid segments, or by polymerizing individual nucleotide precursors. Automated synthesizers allow the synthesis of oligonucleotides up to several hundred base pairs in length. Because oligonucleotides may bind to a complementary nucleotide sequence, they may be used as probes for detecting DNA or RNA. Oligonucleotides composed of DNA (oligodeoxyribonucleotides) may be used in PCR, a technique for the amplification of small DNA sequences. In PCR, the oligonucleotide is typically referred to as a &#x201c;primer&#x201d;, which allows a DNA polymerase to extend the oligonucleotide and replicate the complementary strand.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The terms &#x201c;percent sequence identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;percent identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a sequence comparison based on identical matches between correspondingly identical positions in the sequences being compared between two or more amino acid or nucleotide sequences. The percent identity refers to the extent to which two optimally aligned polynucleotide or peptide sequences are invariant throughout a window of alignment of components, e.g., nucleotides or amino acids. Hybridization experiments and mathematical algorithms known in the art may be used to determine percent identity. Many mathematical algorithms exist as sequence alignment computer programs known in the art that calculate percent identity. These programs may be categorized as either global sequence alignment programs or local sequence alignment programs.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Global sequence alignment programs calculate the percent identity of two sequences by comparing alignments end-to-end in order to find exact matches, dividing the number of exact matches by the length of the shorter sequences, and then multiplying by 100. Basically, the percentage of identical nucleotides in a linear polynucleotide sequence of a reference (&#x201c;query) polynucleotide molecule as compared to a test (&#x201c;subject&#x201d;) polynucleotide molecule when the two sequences are optimally aligned (with appropriate nucleotide insertions, deletions, or gaps).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Local sequence alignment programs are similar in their calculation, but only compare aligned fragments of the sequences rather than utilizing an end-to-end analysis. Local sequence alignment programs such as BLAST can be used to compare specific regions of two sequences. A BLAST comparison of two sequences results in an E-value, or expectation value, that represents the number of different alignments with scores equivalent to or better than the raw alignment score, S, that are expected to occur in a database search by chance. The lower the E value, the more significant the match. Because database size is an element in E-value calculations, E-values obtained by BLASTing against public databases, such as GENBANK, have generally increased over time for any given query/entry match. In setting criteria for confidence of polypeptide function prediction, a &#x201c;high&#x201d; BLAST match is considered herein as having an E-value for the top BLAST hit of less than 1E-30; a medium BLASTX E-value is 1E-30 to 1E-8; and a low BLASTX E-value is greater than 1E-8. The protein function assignment in the present disclosure is determined using combinations of E-values, percent identity, query coverage and hit coverage. Query coverage refers to the percent of the query sequence that is represented in the BLAST alignment. Hit coverage refers to the percent of the database entry that is represented in the BLAST alignment. In one embodiment of the disclosure, function of a query polypeptide is inferred from function of a conserved protein sequence where either (1) hit_p&#x3c;1e-30 or % identity&#x3e;35% AND query_coverage&#x3e;50% AND hit_coverage&#x3e;50%, or (2) hit_p&#x3c;1e-8 AND query_coverage&#x3e;70% AND hit_coverage&#x3e;70%.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Methods for aligning sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Various programs and alignment algorithms are described. In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using an AlignX alignment program of the Vector NTI suite (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The AlignX alignment program is a global sequence alignment program for polynucleotides or proteins. In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the MegAlign program of the LASERGENE bioinformatics computing suite (MegAlign&#x2122; (&#xa9;1993-2016). DNASTAR. Madison, Wis.). The MegAlign program is global sequence alignment program for polynucleotides or proteins. In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the Clustal suite of alignment programs, including, but not limited to, ClustalW and ClustalV (Higgins and Sharp (1988) Gene. December 15; 73(1):237-44; Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS 5:151-3; Higgins et al. (1992) Comput. Appl. Biosci. 8:189-91). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the BLAST suite of alignment programs, for example, but not limited to, BLASTP, BLASTN, BLASTX, etc. (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10). Further examples of such BLAST alignment programs include Gapped-BLAST or PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the EMBOSS suite of alignment programs, including, but not limited to: Matcher, Needle, Stretcher, Water, Wordmatch, etc. (Rice, P., Longden, I. &#x26; Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite. <i>Trends in Genetics </i>16(6) 276-77 (2000)). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the Gap alignment program of Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, <i>Journal of Molecular Biology </i>48:443-453, 1970). In an embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to calculating percent identity between two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences using the BestFit alignment program of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, <i>Advances in Applied Mathematics, </i>2:482-489, 1981, Smith et al., Nucleic Acids Research 11:2205-2220, 1983). These programs produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments of divergent sequences. The calculated best match alignments for the selected sequences are lined up so that identities, similarities, and differences can be seen.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The term &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; refers to a comparison between amino acid sequences, and takes into account not only identical amino acids in corresponding positions, but also functionally similar amino acids in corresponding positions. Thus similarity between polypeptide sequences indicates functional similarity, in addition to sequence similarity.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The term &#x201c;homology&#x201d; is sometimes used to refer to the level of similarity between two or more nucleic acid or amino acid sequences in terms of percent of positional identity (i.e., sequence similarity or identity). Homology also refers to the concept of evolutionary relatedness, often evidenced by similar functional properties among different nucleic acids or proteins that share similar sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variants&#x201d; means substantially similar sequences. For nucleotide sequences, naturally occurring variants can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, such as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For nucleotide sequences, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. As used herein, a &#x201c;native&#x201d; nucleotide sequence comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence. For nucleotide sequences, naturally occurring variants can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined below. Variant nucleotide sequences also include synthetically derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis.

For instance, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. When recombinantly produced, operably linked nucleic acid sequences are generally contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, in the same reading frame. However, elements need not be contiguous to be operably linked.</p>

A control can be &#x201c;positive&#x201d; or &#x201c;negative&#x201d;. For example, where the purpose of an analytical procedure is to detect a differentially expressed transcript or polypeptide in cells or tissue, it is generally preferable to include a positive control, such as a sample from a known plant exhibiting the desired expression, and a negative control, such as a sample from a known plant lacking the desired expression.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As used herein, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; includes a whole plant and any descendant, cell, tissue, or part of a plant. A class of plant that can be used in the present disclosure is generally as broad as the class of higher and lower plants amenable to mutagenesis including angiosperms (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants), gymnosperms, ferns and multicellular algae. Thus, &#x201c;plant&#x201d; includes dicot and monocot plants.

A plant tissue or plant organ may be a seed, protoplast, callus, or any other group of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. A plant cell or tissue culture may be capable of regenerating a plant having the physiological and morphological characteristics of the plant from which the cell or tissue was obtained, and of regenerating a plant having substantially the same genotype as the plant. In contrast, some plant cells are not capable of being regenerated to produce plants. Regenerable cells in a plant cell or tissue culture may be embryos, protoplasts, meristematic cells, callus, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Plant parts include harvestable parts and parts useful for propagation of progeny plants. Plant parts useful for propagation include, for example and without limitation: seed; fruit; a cutting; a seedling; a tuber; and a rootstock. A harvestable part of a plant may be any useful part of a plant, including, for example and without limitation: flower; pollen; seedling; tuber; leaf; stem; fruit; seed; and root.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A plant cell is the structural and physiological unit of the plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. A plant cell may be in the form of an isolated single cell, or an aggregate of cells (e.g., a friable callus and a cultured cell), and may be part of a higher organized unit (e.g., a plant tissue, plant organ, and plant). Thus, a plant cell may be a protoplast, a gamete producing cell, or a cell or collection of cells that can regenerate into a whole plant. As such, a seed, which comprises multiple plant cells and is capable of regenerating into a whole plant, is considered a &#x201c;plant cell&#x201d; in embodiments herein.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As used herein, linkage between genes or markers refers to the phenomenon in which genes or markers on a chromosome show a measurable probability of being passed on together to individuals in the next generation. The closer two genes or markers are to each other, the closer to (1) this probability becomes. Thus, the term &#x201c;linked.&#x201d; may refer to one or more genes or markers that are passed together with a gene with a probability greater than 0.5 (which is expected from independent assortment where markers/genes are located on different chromosomes) Because the proximity of two genes or markers on a chromosome is directly related to the probability that the genes or markers will be passed together to individuals in the next generation, the term &#x201c;linked&#x201d; may also refer herein to one or more genes or markers that are located within about 2.0 Mb of one another on the same <i>Brassica </i>spp. chromosome. Thus, two &#x201c;linked&#x201d; genes or markers may be separated by about 2.1 Mb; 2.00 Mb; about 1.95 Mb: about 1.90 Mb, about 1.85 Mb; about 1.80 Mb; about 1.75 Mb; about 1.70 Mb; about 1.65 Mb; about 1.60 Mb; about 1.55 Mb; about 1.50 Mb; about 1.45 Mb; about 1.40 Mb; about 1.35 Mb; about 1.30 Mb; about 1.25 Mb; about 1.20 Mb; about 1.15 Mb; about 1.10 Mb, about 1.05 Mb, about 1.00 Mb; about 0.95 Mb; about 0.90 Mb; about 0.85 Mb; about 0.80 Mb; about 0.75 Mb; about 0.70 Mb, about 0.65 Mb; about 0.60 Mb; about 0.55 Mb; about 0.50 Mb; about 0.45 Mb; about 0.40 Mb; about 0.35 Mb; about 0.30 Mb; about 0.25 Mb; about 0.20 Mb; about 0.15 Mb; about 0.10 Mb; about 0.05 Mb; about 0.025 Mb; about 0.012 Mb; and about 0.01 Mb. A gene may be &#x201c;linked&#x201d; to a marker that resides within an exon or intron of the gene. In this case, the separation between the linked gene and marker is 0.00 Mb.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Markers and/or genes may also be &#x201c;linked&#x201d; to a phenotype, for example, a phenotype in which the linked gene or gene linked to the linked marker is involved. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the length of this marker will vary if nucleotides are added or subtracted from the span of genomic DNA located between the distal ends of the particular primers used when annealed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tightly linked&#x201d; may refer to one or more genes or markers that are located within about 0.5 Mb of one another on the same chromosome. Thus, two &#x201c;tightly linked&#x201d; genes or markers may be separated by about 0.6 Mb; about 0.55 Mb; 0.5 Mb; about 0.45 Mb; about 0.4 Mb; about 0.35 Mb; about 0.3 Mb; about 0.25 Mb; about 0.2 Mb; about 0.15 Mb; about 0.12 Mb; about 0.1 Mb, about 0.05 Mb, and about 0.00 Mb.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As used herein, the term &#x201c;extremely tightly linked&#x201d; may refer to one or more genes or markers that are located within about 100 kb of one another on the same chromosome. Thus, two &#x201c;extremely tightly linked&#x201d; genes or markers may be separated by about 125 kb; about 120 kb; about 115 kb; about 110 kb; about 105 kb; 100 kb; about 95 kb; about 90 kb; about 85 kb, about 80 kb; about 75 kb; about 70 kb; about 65 kb; about 60 kb, about 55 kb; about 50 kb; about 45 kb; about 40 kb; about 35 kb; about 30 kb; about 25 kb; about 20 kb; about 15 kb; about 12 kb; about 10 kb; about 5 kb; about 1 kb, and about 0 kb.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Linked, tightly linked, and extremely tightly genetic markers may be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs to identify individuals comprising linked phenotypes and/or gene types, and to breed these traits and/or genes into <i>Brassica </i>varieties.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Additional markers can be identified as equivalent to this exemplary marker, for example, by determining the frequency of recombination between the additional marker and the exemplary SSR marker Such determinations may utilize an improved method of orthogonal contrasts based on the method of Mather (1931), <i>The Measurement of Linkage in Heredity</i>, Methuen &#x26; Co., London, followed by a test of maximum likelihood to determine a recombination frequency. Allard (1956) Hilgardia 24:235-78. If the value of the recombination frequency is less than or equal to 0.10 (i.e., 10%) in any cultivar, then the additional marker is considered equivalent to the particular reference marker for the purposes of use in the presently disclosed methods.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As used herein, the term &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; as used herein refers to the fertilization of female plants (or gametes) by male plants (or gametes). The term &#x201c;gamete&#x201d; refers to the haploid reproductive cell (egg or sperm) produced in plants by mitosis from a gametophyte and involved in sexual reproduction, during which two gametes of opposite sex fuse to form a diploid zygote. The term generally includes reference to a pollen (including the sperm cell) and an ovule (including the ovum). &#x201c;Crossing&#x201d; therefore generally refers to the fertilization of ovules of one individual with pollen from another individual, whereas &#x201c;selfing&#x201d; refers to the fertilization of ovules of an individual with pollen from the same individual. When referring to crossing in the context of achieving the introgression of a genomic region or segment, the skilled person will understand that in order to achieve the introgression of only a part of a chromosome of one plant into the chromosome of another plant, it is required that random portions of the genomes of both parental lines will be recombined during the cross due to the occurrence of crossing-over events in the production of the gametes in the parent lines. Therefore, the genomes of both parents must be combined in a single cell by a cross, where after the production of gametes from said cell and their fusion in fertilization will result in an introgression event.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The term &#x201c;zygosity&#x201d; means determining whether the source of nucleic acid appears heterozygous, homozygous, or hemizygous.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As used herein, the term &#x201c;heterozygous&#x201d; means a genetic condition existing when different alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As used herein, the term &#x201c;homozygous&#x201d; means a genetic condition existing when identical alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hemizygous&#x201d; means having an allele of a gene at a given locus on one chromosome in the diploid state, for which there is no corresponding locus on the other chromosome of the pair.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As used herein, the term &#x201c;introgression&#x201d; refers to a genomic segment that has moved from one individual, species, variety or cultivar into the genome of another individual, species, variety or cultivar, by crossing those individuals, species, varieties or cultivars.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;introgressing&#x201d;, &#x201c;introgress&#x201d; and &#x201c;introgressed&#x201d; refer to both a natural and artificial process whereby individual genes or entire traits are moved from one individual, species, variety or cultivar into the genome of another species, variety or cultivar, by crossing those species, varieties or cultivars. In plant breeding, the process usually involves selfing or backcrossing to the recurrent parent to provide for an increasingly homozygous plant having essentially the characteristics of the recurrent parent in addition to the introgressed gene or trait.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The term &#x201c;backcross&#x201d; refers to the process wherein the plant resulting from a cross between two parental lines is crossed with one of its parental lines, wherein the parental line used in the backcross is referred to as the recurrent parent. Repeated backcrossing results in the genome becoming more and more homozygous or inbred.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The term &#x201c;selfing&#x201d; refers to the process of self-fertilization wherein an individual is pollinated or fertilized with its own pollen.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments an amplicon can be detected. In an aspect of this embodiment the amplicon is detected on an agarose gel via electrophoresis. Those with skill in the art appreciate the various types of agarose gel electrophoresis reagents and techniques that may be used. For instance pulsed field gel electrophoresis, pulsed orthogonal gel electrophoresis agarose multigel electrophoresis, and traditional agarose gel electrophoresis can be used with the subject disclosure. In further embodiments the size of the amplicon can be detected to determine whether the assay for the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocations in <i>B. napus</i>. In an aspect the size of the amplicon can be about 50 base pairs, 100 base pairs, 150 base pairs, 200 base pairs, 250 base pairs, 300 base pairs, 350 base pairs, 400 base pairs, 450 base pairs, 500 base pairs, 550 base pairs, 600 base pairs, 650 base pairs, 700 base pairs, 750 base pairs, 800 base pairs, 850 base pairs, 900 base pairs, 950 base pairs, 1 kilobase pairs, 2 kilobase pairs, 3 kilobase pairs, 4 kilobase pairs, 5 kilobase pairs, 6 kilobase pairs, 7 kilobase pairs, 8 kilobase pairs, 9 kilobase pairs, 10 kilobase pairs, 11 kilobase pairs, 12 kilobase pairs, 13 kilobase pairs, 14 kilobase pairs, 15 kilobase pairs, 16 kilobase pairs, 17 kilobase pairs, 18 kilobase pairs, 19 kilobase pairs, or 20 kilobase pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Following the completion of the PCR reaction and probe detection, a table and distribution graph may be generated using, for example, any suitable computer graphics software. Results obtained with wild-type, hemizygous and homozygous DNA of similar and/or known genotypic backgrounds may serve as positive or negative controls. In a segregating population, three clusters of data points may be obtained, allowing the visual determination of a sample result as likely belonging to one of the segregated clusters. Alternatively, data analysis computer software may be used to calculate the probability that a sample result belongs to each segregated cluster, with the most probable cluster serving as the sample designation. When a visual determination is made, the boundary of each cluster may be arbitrary, for example, when three clusters of data points are clearly visible.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Raw fluorescence intensity data may also be analyzed directly from a plate reader using a suitable analysis package, such as KLIMS (KBioscience laboratory information management system). A graph with the relative fluorescence units (RFU) of a fluorescence signal generated by a specific probe for a mutant allele plotted on one axis, and the RFU of a fluorescence signal generated by a specific probe for the wild-type allele plotted on the other axis may be generated. Zygosity determinations may then be made based on the cluster separation in a graphical display of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Samples that do not contain the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in a <i>B. napus </i>may only result in fluorescence readings of the wild-type PCR product. Samples containing hemizygous or homozygous mutant genomic DNA may result in RFU readings for the mutant-specific probe higher than that of a negative background control. If a sample yields no adequate results, the genomic DNA in the sample may not be of adequate quality and/or quantity, and a new DNA preparation and/or new PCR reaction should be performed. Preferably, a negative control sample containing no DNA sample shows very low detection of gene-specific probe(s). It is also preferable that known homozygous controls show only high detection of the mutant or wild-type DNA in the control, and that known hemizygous controls show both high detection of the mutant and wild-type DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In an embodiment, the amplification reaction is quantified. In other embodiments, the amplification reaction is quantitated using a signature profile, in which the signature profile is selected from the group consisting of a melting temperature or a fluorescence signature profile. In some embodiments the amplification reaction is quantitated via the Delta Delta ct method. In other embodiments the amplification reaction is quantitated via the comparative cycle threshold method. In further embodiments the amplification reaction is quantitated via the standard curve method.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Standard Curve. Nucleic acids can be used to establish a standard curve. These methods are well known and include internal controls, double stranded DNA, a cDNA expressing a target gene, or an in vitro generated single stranded DNA. Methods may vary according to the nucleic acid chosen to serve as the standard to establish a standard curve.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Comparative Cycle Threshold. The comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method, also known as the 2<sup>&#x2212;&#x394;&#x394;Ct </sup>method, is also used to quantify DNA levels. The Ct method compares a test reaction with a control or calibrator sample. The Ct values of both the control/calibrator sample and the test sample are normalized. In an embodiment of the invention, the Ct values were normalized to an arbitrary cutoff, 20-22. In another embodiment, the Ct values were normalized to within 1 Ct value of a negative control (a sample with no inhibition). This allows for the sensitivity of the assay and proper dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Ct Method. The Ct method can also be described by the &#x394;&#x394;Ct formula; &#x394;&#x394;Ct=&#x394;Ct<sub>test sample</sub>&#x2212;&#x394;Ct<sub>reference sample</sub>. The amplification efficiencies of the test sample and the reference sample must be about the same for the formula to operate. Amplification efficiencies can be determined by a comparison of the samples with template dilution. The amplification efficiency is about the same when a plot of cDNA dilution versus &#x394;Ct approximates zero.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">DNA may be isolated (for example, extracted, and purified) from plant tissue by methods known to those of skill in the art. Commercial kits for DNA isolation are available, for example, from Qiagen, Inc. In some embodiments, leaf discs from a particular plant are punched and transferred into collection tubes. The puncher may be cleaned after each sampling with 70% alcohol, rinsing in water, and drying. DNA extraction buffers may be prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA may then be isolated using the kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the concentration of the isolated DNA may be determined using, for example, a Quant-iT&#x2122; PicoGreen&#xae; Quantification Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and a spectrophotometer, or by any other suitable technique.</p>

For example the detection of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in <i>B. napus </i>can be achieved, for example, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Size separation of DNA fragments on agarose or polyacrylamide gels following amplification, comprises the major part of the methodology. Such selection and screening methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art. Molecular confirmation methods that can be used to identify transgenic plants are known to those with skill in the art. Several exemplary methods are further described below.</p>

The FRET probe and PCR primers (one primer in the insert DNA sequence and one in the flanking genomic sequence) are cycled in the presence of a thermostable polymerase and dNTPs. Following successful PCR amplification, hybridization of the FRET probe(s) to the target sequence results in the removal of the probe secondary structure and spatial separation of the fluorescent and quenching moieties.

<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In subsequent embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to a <i>B. napus </i>cell comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In other embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to a <i>B. napus </i>plant part comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In further embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to a <i>B. napus </i>plant tissue comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In additional embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to a <i>B. napus </i>plant comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In some embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to a <i>B. napus </i>seed comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">An embodiment of the subject disclosure provides a method for producing a <i>B. napus </i>seed comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation, the method comprising the steps of: a) crossing a female parent plant with a male parent plant; b) harvesting a progeny seed from the cross of (a); c) planting the progeny seed; and, d) growing the progeny seed, wherein the progeny seed comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In additional embodiments, the subject disclosure relates to female and male parent plants that are <i>B. napus </i>plants. In further embodiments the male parent plant is isogenic to the female parent plant. In an aspect of the embodiment, the male parent plant is homozygous or heterozygous for the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In another aspect of the embodiment, the female parent plant is homozygous or heterozygous for the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In yet another aspect of the subject disclosure, processes are provided for producing progeny plants, which processes generally comprise crossing a first parent plant with a second parent plant wherein at least one of the first parent plant or the second parent plant comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for producing progeny seed or plants, wherein a first plant is crossed with a second plant.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Any time the male plant is crossed with another, different inbred plant, a progeny or first generation (F<sub>1</sub>) hybrid plant is produced. As such, a progeny or F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid plant may be produced by crossing the first plant with any second inbred plant. Therefore, any progeny or F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid plant or seed that comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation which is produced with the first parent plant as a parent is an embodiment of the subject disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In embodiments of the present disclosure, the step of &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; the <i>B. napus </i>plant comprises planting, preferably in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first inbred <i>B. napus </i>plant and a second, distinct inbred <i>B. napus </i>plant. In other embodiments, the step of &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; the <i>B. napus </i>plant comprises planting, manually pollinating a first inbred <i>B. napus </i>plant with pollen to a second, distinct inbred <i>B. napus </i>plant.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In an embodiment, the <i>B. napus </i>plant that comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation are treated with one or more agricultural chemicals as considered appropriate by the grower.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">A further step comprises harvesting the seeds, near or at maturity, from the plant that received the pollen. In a particular embodiment, seed is harvested from the female parent plant, and when desired, the harvested seed can be grown to produce a progeny or first generation (F<sub>1</sub>) hybrid plant.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Yet another step comprises drying and conditioning the seeds, including the treating, sizing (or grading) of seeds, and packaging for sale to growers for the production of oil and grain. As with inbred seed, it may be desirable to treat hybrid seeds with compositions that render the seeds and seedlings grown therefrom more hardy when exposed to adverse conditions. Mention should be made that resulting progeny or hybrid seed may be sold to growers for the production of oil and grain and not for breeding or seed production.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Still further, the subject disclosure provides a progeny plant produced by growing the harvested seeds produced on the <i>B. napus </i>plant that comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation as well as grain produced by the progeny plant.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In an additional embodiment, the subject disclosure relates to a method for producing a progeny plant, the method further comprising the steps of: e) crossing the progeny plant, with another plant comprising a desired trait to produce F1 progeny plants; f) selecting F1 progeny plants that have the desired trait to produce selected F1 progeny plants; g) crossing the selected F1 progeny plants with the progeny <i>B. napus </i>plant that comprises the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation plant to produce backcross progeny plants; h) selecting for backcross progeny plants that have the desired trait; and, i) repeating steps (g) and (h) three or more times in succession to produce selected fourth or higher backcross progeny plants that comprise the desired trait.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Various breeding schemes may be used to produce progeny plants. In one method, generally referred to as the pedigree method, the parent may be crossed with another different plant such as a second inbred parent plant, which either itself exhibits one or more selected desirable characteristic(s) or imparts selected desirable characteristic(s) to a hybrid combination. If the two original parent plants do not provide all the desired characteristics, then other sources can be included in the breeding population. Progeny plants, that is, pure breeding, homozygous inbred lines, can also be used as starting materials for breeding or source populations from which to develop progeny plants.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Thereafter, resulting seed is harvested and resulting superior progeny plants are selected and selfed or sib-mated in succeeding generations, such as for about five to about seven or more generations, until a generation is produced that no longer segregates for substantially all factors for which the inbred parents differ, thereby providing a large number of distinct, pure-breeding inbred lines.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In another embodiment for generating progeny plants, generally referred to as backcrossing, one or more desired traits may be introduced into the parent by crossing the parent plants with another plant (referred to as the donor or non-recurrent parent) which carries the gene(s) encoding the particular trait(s) of interest to produce F<sub>1 </sub>progeny plants. Both dominant and recessive alleles may be transferred by backcrossing. The donor plant may also be an inbred, but in the broadest sense can be a member of any plant variety or population cross-fertile with the recurrent parent. Next, F<sub>1 </sub>progeny plants that have the desired trait are selected. Then, the selected progeny plants are crossed with the parent or restored fertile parent to produce backcross progeny plants. Thereafter, backcross progeny plants comprising the desired trait and the physiological and morphological characteristics of the parent are selected. This cycle is repeated for about one to about eight cycles, preferably for about three or more times in succession to produce selected higher backcross progeny plants that comprise the desired trait and all of the physiological and morphological characteristics of the parent when grown in the same environmental conditions. Exemplary desired trait(s) include insect resistance, enhanced nutritional quality, herbicide resistance, yield stability, yield enhancement and resistance to bacterial, fungal and viral disease. One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would appreciate that a breeder uses various methods to help determine which plants should be selected from the segregating populations and ultimately which inbred lines will be used to develop hybrids for commercialization. In addition to the knowledge of the germplasm and other skills the breeder uses, a part of the selection process is dependent on experimental design coupled with the use of statistical analysis. Experimental design and statistical analysis are used to help determine which plants, which family of plants, and finally which inbred lines and hybrid combinations are significantly better or different for one or more traits of interest. Experimental design methods are used to assess error so that differences between two inbred lines or two hybrid lines can be more accurately determined. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of mean values, determination of the statistical significance of the sources of variation, and the calculation of the appropriate variance components. Either a five or a one percent significance level is customarily used to determine whether a difference that occurs for a given trait is real or due to the environment or experimental error. One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would know how to evaluate the traits of two plant varieties to determine if there is no significant difference between the two traits expressed by those varieties. For example, see Fehr, Walt, Principles of Cultivar Development, p. 261-286 (1987) which is incorporated herein by reference. Mean trait values may be used to determine whether trait differences are significant, and preferably the traits are measured on plants grown under the same environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">This method results in the generation of progeny inbred plants with substantially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent and the particular transferred trait(s) of interest. Because such progeny inbred plants are heterozygous for loci controlling the transferred trait(s) of interest, the last backcross generation would subsequently be selfed to provide pure breeding progeny for the transferred trait(s).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In other embodiments for generating progeny plants the subject disclosure relates to the production of doubled haploid plants produced from <i>B. napus </i>microspores, wherein the doubled haploid plants comprise the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. Those with skill in the art would appreciate that a microspore derived embryo may be produced from microspores that are obtained from the anthers of <i>B. napus</i>. These microspores&#x2014;formed from pollen mother cells that undergo meiosis&#x2014;are generated into embryos and later into mature plant by maintenance on the appropriate culture media followed by transfer to soil. The microspores are haploid cells. Those with skill in the art would understand that in some instances a haploid cell may spontaneously give rise to a diploid cell or cells following mitosis. Likewise, those with skill in the art would understand that a chromosome-doubling agent may be applied to increase the ploidy of a haploid cell. In aspects of such an embodiment the haploid cell becomes a diploid cell. Such a diploid cell may give rise to a <i>B. napus </i>plant comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. The methods of the present disclosure do not depend on a particular genetic mechanism of chromosome doubling. Typically, induced chromosome doubling of the invention involves administering an effective amount of a chromosome-doubling agent to a cell, preferably a haploid cell. Any agent that is known to increase the ploidy of cells may be employed in the methods of the subject disclosure. Exemplary, and non-limiting, chromosome doubling agents include, but are not limited to, trifluralin, colchicine, oryzalin, amiprophosmethyl and pronamide. Depending on the desired outcome, a chromosome-doubling agent may be administered to a tissue, or a cell thereof, but, is usually the doubling agent is applied directly to microspores via addition to the culture medium. In certain aspects of this embodiment, an effective amount of a chromosome-doubling agent is administered after obtaining the haploid embryo. In other aspects of this embodiment, an effective amount of a chromosome-doubling agent is administered at the microspore stage of <i>B. napus </i>development. Accordingly, the subject disclosure provides methods and compositions for developing progeny plants comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation from <i>B. napus </i>microspores.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In further embodiments the subject disclosure relates to the determination of recombinant genetic frequencies in <i>B. napus </i>plants comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In certain aspects, doubled haploid <i>B. napus </i>plants comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation produced from microspores are used to determine the recombinant genetic frequencies. In other aspects, progeny <i>B. napus </i>plants comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation are used to determine the recombinant genetic frequencies. In an aspect of this embodiment, the assays disclosed for the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation can be performed to identify linkage disequilibrium within the disclosed genomic sequences; for example, SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3 and/or SEQ ID NO:4. The linkage of the polynucleotides from these genomic sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, and/or SEQ ID NO:4) can be assayed using the methodologies and compositions as provided within this disclosure to determine the relative genetic distance to the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In an aspect of this embodiment, the assays disclosed for the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation can be performed to identify linkage disequilibrium within any <i>B. napus </i>genomic sequence on chromosome 7 or chromosome 16. The linkage of the polynucleotides from any <i>B. napus </i>genomic sequence on chromosome 7 or chromosome 16 can be assayed using the methodologies and compositions as provided within this disclosure to determine the relative genetic distance to the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. In some aspects the linkage between the polynucleotides assayed from the genomic sequences can be linked, tightly linked, or extremely tightly linked to the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. Those with skill in the art would appreciate that linkage of any polynucleotide sequence from the genomic sequences as disclosed herein (for example, SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, and/or SEQ ID NO:4) to the breakage point of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation may refer to the phenomenon in which the polynucleotides show a measurable probability of being passed on with the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in the next generation. Likewise, those with skill in the art would appreciate that linkage of any polynucleotide sequence from within any <i>B. napus </i>genomic sequence on chromosome 7 or chromosome 16 to the breakage point of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation may refer to the phenomenon in which the polynucleotides show a measurable probability of being passed on with the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation in the next generation. Thus, those with skill in the art would appreciate that the linkage of one polynucleotide sequence to another polynucleotide sequence may be measured and/or expressed as a recombination frequency. When the presence of a gene contributes to a phenotype in an individual, any polynucleotide sequences that are linked to the gene may be said to be linked to the phenotype. Accordingly, in aspects of this disclosure when the presence of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation contributes to a phenotype in an individual, the polynucleotide sequences of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation as provided in this subject disclosure that are linked to the gene may be said to be linked to the phenotype.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In a subsequent embodiment, the disclosure related to introducing a desired trait into <i>B. napus </i>plants comprising the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation plant. In an aspect of the embodiment, the desired trait is selected from the group consisting of a native trait or a transgenic trait that includes an insecticidal resistance trait, herbicide tolerant trait, disease resistance trait, yield increase trait, nutritional quality trait, agronomic increase trait, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The Introgression of a desirable trait in plants may be facilitated by repeated backcrossing. Described herein are methods for producing a <i>B. napus </i>plant with N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation, through conventional plant breeding involving sexual reproduction. Methods may comprise crossing a first parent plant that comprises in its genome at least one copy of a trait to a second parent plant, so as to produce F<sub>1 </sub>progeny. The first plant can be any plant or variety of <i>B. napus</i>. The second parent plant can be any plant that is capable of producing viable progeny plants (i.e., seeds) when crossed with the first plant. The first and second parent plants may be of the same <i>B. napus </i>line or variety. The methods may further involve selfing the F<sub>1 </sub>progeny to produce F<sub>2 </sub>progeny. Methods may further involve one or more generations of backcrossing the F<sub>1 </sub>or F<sub>2 </sub>progeny plants to a plant of the same line or genotype as either the first or second parent plant. Alternatively, the F<sub>1 </sub>progeny of the first cross, or any subsequent cross, can be crossed to a third plant that is of a different line or genotype than either the first or second plant.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some embodiments, progeny plants are subjected to a genotype and/or zygosity determination, as outlined in the disclosure. Once progeny plants have been genotyped, and/or their zygosity determined, the skilled artisan may select those progeny plants that have a desired genetic composition. Such selected progeny plants may be used in further crosses, selfing, or cultivation. Methods of introgression of a trait that are directed according to methods of the disclosure reduce or eliminate the cultivation and/or reproduction of plants that do not have a desired genetic composition, and thereby provide desirable reliability and predictability (through expected Mendelian patterns of inheritance).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Backcrossing may be accelerated by the use of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation assays of the pending application to identify plants with the greatest genetic complement from the recurrent parent.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Direct selection may be applied where a single locus acts as a dominant trait, such as the herbicide resistance trait. For this selection process, the progeny of the initial cross are sprayed with the herbicide before the backcrossing. The spraying eliminates any plants which do not have the desired herbicide resistance characteristic, and only those plants which have the herbicide resistance gene are used in the subsequent backcross. In the instance where the characteristic being transferred is a recessive allele, it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired characteristic has been successfully transferred. The process of selection, whether direct or indirect, is then repeated for all additional backcross generations.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">It should be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that backcrossing can be combined with pedigree breeding as where the parent is crossed with another plant, the resultant progeny are crossed back to the parent or restored fertile parent and thereafter, the resulting progeny of this single backcross are subsequently inbred to develop new inbred lines. This combination of backcrossing and pedigree breeding is useful as when recovery of fewer than all of the parent characteristics than would be obtained by a conventional backcross are desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 1: Discovery and Validation of Chromosomal N7/N16 Reciprocal Translocation Break Points in <i>B. napus </i></heading>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">To discover the location of the N7/N16 chromosomal break point in <i>B. napus</i>, an end-to-end chromosome assembly based on single molecule long read sequencing for <i>B. napus </i>line NS1822BC was developed. The resulting reference genetic map of line NS1822BC revealed the presence of an N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. Using a global alignment of the NS1822BC genome with that of publicly available <i>B. napus </i>line DH12075 genome (which does not contain the N7/N6 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation), the location and sequences of the two break-points on N7 and N16 chromosomes were identified for the first time. As provided herein, SEQ ID N04: provides the sequence of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation of chromosome 16 as compared to the wildtype sequence of chromosome 16 of SEQ ID NO:3. As provided herein, SEQ ID NO:2: provides the sequence of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation of chromosome 7 as compared to the wildtype sequence of chromosome 7 of SEQ ID NO:1. This analysis resulted in the precise estimation of the genetic and physical length of the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation (Table 1). Furthermore, it was discovered that nearly one-third of the bottom end of the N7 chromosome (a 37 cM segment starting from 65.8 cM to the end of the chromosome at 102.8 cM in genetic space and an &#x2dc;7.8 Mb physical segment starting from 17580520 bp to 25458507 on DH12075 genome) was involved in the homoeotic exchange with N16 chromosome. Similarly, an &#x2dc;9.8 cM genetic segment (0-9.8 cM) at the top of the N16 chromosome (&#x2dc;8.1 Mb physical segment starting from 0-13653938 bp on DH12075 genome) was involved in the homoeotic exchange with N7 chromosome. These exchanged segments were positioned in an inverted orientation in the individuals containing N7/N16 HRT.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Next, the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation was assessed and characterized in elite germplasm lines from North America (NA), Australia (AU), and Europe (EU). From this analysis, it was determined that the N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation is fixed in NA germplasm lines, nearly absent in EU germplasm lines, and segregates in AU germplasm lines (Table 2).</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 2: Detection of N7/N16 Homologous Chromosomal Reciprocal Translocation Using Agarose-Based PCR Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0215" num="0212">The genome sequence of the public DH12075 line that does not contain the N7/N16 translocation was used to develop two &#x201c;wild type PCR assays&#x201d; to detect the absence of the reciprocal chromosomal exchanges at both the N7 and N16 chromosomal sites respectively. The assays were designed using primers (Primer3 software: available on the world wide web at bioprod.phibred.com/primer3/cgi-bin/primer3_www.cgi) that flank the site of break-point sequences (Table 3, and Table 4). PCR amplification products from these assays when run on an (1%) agarose gel produced a band of 2,366 bp for N7 and 1,963 bp for N16, diagnostic for the wild type configuration or absence of the N7/N16 translocation.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0213">The genome sequence of the proprietary NS1822BC line that does contain the N7/N16 translocation was used to develop two PCR assays each on N7 and N16 that detect the reciprocal translocation. These assays were developed using primers that flank the chromosome exchange points on N7 and N16 chromosome sequences (Table 3, and Table 4). When run on the agarose gels these assays produce products of 1,828 bp for N7 and 1,893 bp for N16 that will detect the presence of N7 and N16 reciprocal recombination.</p>

<p id="p-0219" num="0214">The lines NS1882BC (confirmed to have the translocation) and DH12075 (confirmed to not contain the translocation) were used as positive and negative controls when testing the effectiveness of the PCR assay to detect the presence or absence of translocation. PCR reactions were set up in 20 ul volume containing 2 ul of DNA (&#x2dc;8 ng), 4 ul of 100 mM primers (2 ul forward 2 ul reverse), 10 ul Phusion GC Master Mix&#x2122; (Fisher scientific) and 4 ul of water. PCR conditions were as follows: 98&#xb0; C. for 30 secs, followed by 35 cycles of 98&#xb0; C. for 10 secs, 61&#xb0; C. for 30 secs, and 72&#xb0; C. for 120 secs, with a final extension of 72&#xb0; C. for 7 mins and a final infinite hold at 4&#xb0; C. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel (SeaKem GTG Agarose&#x2122; Lonza) containing Sybr Safe (Sybr Safe DNA gel Stain&#x2122;, Unity) in 1&#xd7;TAE buffer (Omnipur TAE buffer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h and visualized and photographed using an Alpha Imager utilizing a bottom illumination plate set to emit light at &#x2dc;530 nm. Gel images were scored with a score of one (1) representing presence and a score of zero (0) representing absence of the reciprocal translocation.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 3: Detection of N7/N16 Homologous Chromosomal Reciprocal Translocation Using High-Throughput Competitive Allele-Specific PCR Genotyping (KASPR&#x2122;) Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0220" num="0215">High-throughput markers greatly facilitate the large-scale germplasm screening and breeding. Co-dominant assays that allow detection of translocated lines from non-translocated for N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation were designed using the breakpoint sites at both N7 and N16 sequences. The KASPAR&#x2032; genotyping system is comprised of two components (1) the SNP-specific assay (a combination of three unlabelled primers), and (2) the universal Reaction Mix, which contains all other required components including the universal fluorescent reporting system and a specially-developed Taq polymerase. The four primers, allele-specific 1 (A1), allele-specific 2 (A2), and two common (C1 and C2), or reverse, (Table 5) were designed using the assay design algorithm of the workflow manager, Kraken&#x2122; (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK).</p>

<p id="p-0222" num="0216">Primers were designed using the LGC Genomics assay design software. As such, 1.5 ul of &#x2dc;4 ng/ul of DNA was used in the assay mix (&#x2dc;6 ng), and 12 ul of 100 mM of each forward primer and 30 ul of 100 mM of each of the common reverse primers and 16 ul of water was combined to make each assay. Next, 13.6 ul of the assay was combined with 1000 ul of KASP Master Mix&#x2122; (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK). A Meridian&#x2122; (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK) liquid handler dispensed 1.3 ul of the mix onto a 1536 plate containing &#x2dc;6 ng of dried DNA. The plate was sealed with a Phusion&#x2122; laser sealer (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK) and thermocycled using a LGC Genomics&#x2122; Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK hydrocycler with the following conditions: 95&#xb0; C. for 15 min, 10 cycles of 95&#xb0; C. for 20 sec, 61&#xb0; C. stepped down to 55&#xb0; C. for 1 min, 29 cycles of 95&#xb0; C. for 20 sec, and 55&#xb0; C. for 1 min. The excitation at wavelengths 485 (FAM) and 520 (VIC) was measured with a Pherastar&#x2122; plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The values were normalized against ROX and plotted and scored on scatterplots utilizing the KRAKEN software (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK).</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 4: Detection of N7/N16 Homologous Chromosomal Reciprocal Translocation Using an Endpoint Assay Development</heading>
<p id="p-0223" num="0217">Generally, the endpoint genotyping system is comprised of a forward and reverse primer and two fluoresce labeled probes. The oligonucleotide primers amplify a specific region of the wildtype N7 or N16 chromosome, and the translocated N7 or N16 chromosome. The oligonucleotide probe binds to the amplicon between the two primers and are labeled with the VIC or FAM fluorescent reporter dye, at the 5&#x2032; end and MGBNFQ (minor grove binding non-fluorescent quencher) as a quencher at the 3&#x2032; end.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0218">An exhaustive listing of endpoint genotyping systems (e.g., TAQMAN&#x2122;, KASPAR&#x2122; or other known assays) that rely on amplifiable primers (SEQ ID NO:489-10560) and probes (SEQ ID NO:21-488) that spanned the N7/N16 translocation break-point site were designed.

<p id="p-0225" num="0219">These primer and probe sequences as disclosed herein can be used as diagnostic assays for the detection of N7/N16 homologous chromosomal reciprocal translocation. As such, 1.5 ul of the &#x2dc;6 ng/ul DNA is used in the assay mix, and 18 uM of each probe, and 4 uM of each primer is combined to make each assay. Next, 13.6 ul of the assay is combined with 1000 ul of ToughMix PCR Master Mix&#x2122; (Quanta Beverly, Mass., USA). A Meridian (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK) liquid handler dispenses 1.3 ul of the mix onto a 1536 plate containing &#x2dc;6 ng of dried DNA. The plate is sealed with a Phusion&#x2122; laser sealer (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK) and thermocycled using a LGC Genomics&#x2122; Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK hydrocycler with the following conditions: 94&#xb0; C. for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 30 secs, 60&#xb0; C. for 1 min. PCR products are measured using at wavelengths 485 (FAM) and 520 (VIC) by a Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The values are normalized against ROX and plotted and scored on scatterplots utilizing the KRAKEN software (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, UK). Genotype is determined by the presence or absence of fluorescence specific to the translocation.</p>
