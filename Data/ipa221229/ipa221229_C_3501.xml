<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A rolling fatigue life of a rolling bearing is improved by carbonitriding a surface of a bearing part (a raceway surface of each of an inner ring and an outer ring as well as a rolling contact surface of a rolling element) as described in PTL 1 (Japanese Patent No. 5592540). Moreover, the rolling fatigue life of the rolling bearing is improved by attaining fine prior austenite grains in the surface of the bearing part as described in PTL 2 (Japanese Patent No. 3905430).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A steel used for the bearing part is generally quenched. That is, a quench-hardened layer having a structure mainly composed of a martensite phase is formed in the surface of the bearing part. However, it has not been conventionally known how states of martensite crystal grains affect the rolling fatigue life of the bearing part.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a transmission or differential for an automobile, a low-viscosity lubricating oil tends to be applied in order to improve fuel efficiency or an amount of lubricating oil in a unit tends to be reduced, and such tendencies are also considered to continue in future. Therefore, in a rolling bearing used in such a severe lubricating state, a material matrix of a surface layer of a quench-hardened layer needs to be composed of a stronger structure. Further, in response to downsizing of units, the size (outer diameter or width) of the rolling bearing is required to be decreased; however, an output tends to be high due to motor assisting or provision of a turbo mechanism and an applied load to the rolling bearing (a ratio of the applied load to the bearing rated load) tends to be increased, so that a longer life of the rolling bearing is required. Further, in view of increased popularity of urban car sharing in future, frequency of use and travel distance of an automobile tend to be increased, so that a longer life of the rolling bearing has been desired more than ever.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A maximum contact pressure is applied to a rolling surface (raceway surface or rolling contact surface) at a central position in a rolling surface axial direction. Therefore, in order to attain a long life of the rolling bearing, it is particularly important to improve the material structure of the quench-hardened layer in the rolling surface at the central position in the rolling surface axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described problem of the conventional art. More specifically, the present invention is to provide a rolling bearing having an improved rolling fatigue life.</p>

First, a cross section image (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;EBSD image&#x201d;) in quench-hardened layer <b>50</b> is captured based on the EBSD method. The EBSD image is captured to include a sufficient number (more than or equal to 20) of martensite crystal grains.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In preparing step S<b>1</b>, a processing target member having a cylindrical shape is prepared. The processing target member is formed into inner ring <b>10</b> by performing carbonitriding step S<b>2</b>, first tempering step S<b>3</b>, quenching step S<b>4</b>, second tempering step S<b>5</b> and post-process step S<b>6</b> thereto. In preparing step S<b>1</b>, first, the processing target member is subjected to hot forging. In preparing step S<b>1</b>, second, the processing target member is subjected to cold forging. In preparing step S<b>1</b>, third, cutting is performed to provide the processing target member with a shape close to the shape of inner ring <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In carbonitriding step S<b>2</b>, first, by heating the processing target member to a temperature of more than or equal to a first temperature, the processing target member is carbonitrided. The first temperature is a temperature of more than or equal to an A<sub>1 </sub>transformation point of the steel of the processing target member. In carbonitriding step S<b>2</b>, second, the processing target member is cooled. This cooling is performed such that the temperature of the processing target member becomes less than or equal to an Ms transformation point.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In first tempering step S<b>3</b>, the processing target member is tempered. First tempering step S<b>3</b> is performed by holding the processing target member at a second temperature for a first period of time.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In second tempering step S<b>5</b>, the processing target member is tempered.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Hereinafter, effects of rolling bearing <b>100</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When material failure is considered in accordance with the weakest link model, portions each having a relatively low strength, i.e., martensite crystal grains each having a relatively large crystal grain size have a great influence on the material failure. In quench-hardened layer <b>50</b>, the average grain size of the martensite crystal grains belonging to the first group (third group) is less than or equal to 0.97 &#x3bc;m (less than or equal to 0.75 &#x3bc;m). Accordingly, in rolling bearing <b>100</b>, even such relatively large martensite crystal grains belonging to the first group (third group) are fine crystal grains, with the result that rolling fatigue strength and static load capacity are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As the average aspect ratio of the martensite crystal grains becomes smaller, the shape of each of the martensite crystal grains becomes closer to a spherical shape, with the result that stress concentration is less likely to take place. Accordingly, when the average aspect ratio of the martensite crystal grains belonging to the first group (third group) is less than or equal to 2.57 (less than or equal to 2.45), the rolling fatigue strength and static load capacity can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In rolling bearing <b>100</b>, the volume ratio of the austenite crystal grains in the surface of quench-hardened layer <b>50</b> at the central position in the rolling surface axial direction is less than or equal to 30%, so that the hardness of quench-hardened layer <b>50</b> in the surface can be suppressed from being decreased (more specifically, the hardness of more than or equal to 670 Hv can be maintained).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It should be noted that since each of rolling bearing <b>200</b> and rolling bearing <b>300</b> has the same configuration as that of rolling bearing <b>100</b> except for the type of bearing, the rolling fatigue life and the static load capacity are improved in the same manner as in rolling bearing <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Hereinafter, a rolling fatigue test and a static load capacity test performed to confirm the effects of rolling bearing <b>100</b> will be described.</p>

The rolling fatigue test was performed under conditions that the rotating speed of the inner ring was 3000 rotations/min and the maximum contact pressure was 2.6 GPa. In the rolling fatigue test, bath lubrication was performed using VG56, which is a turbine oil. In this turbine oil, hard gas-atomized powder was mixed at a ratio of 0.2 g/l. The test conditions for the rolling fatigue test are shown in Table 3. It should be noted that the rolling fatigue test was performed onto six tapered roller bearings each produced using sample 1 and six tapered roller bearings each produced using sample 3.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0100">In the static load capacity test, flat plate-like members were produced using samples 1 to 3. The static load capacity test was performed by finding a relation between the maximum contact pressure and the indentation depth by pressing a ceramic ball composed of silicon nitride against a surface of each of the flat plate-like members having been mirror-finished. It should be noted that the static load capacity was evaluated in accordance with the maximum contact pressure when a value obtained by dividing the indentation depth by the diameter of the ceramic ball reached 1/10000 (when a value obtained by dividing the indentation depth by the diameter of the ceramic ball and multiplying by 10000 reached 1).</p>

On the other hand, each of the tapered roller bearings prepared using sample 3 had an L<sub>50 </sub>life of 31.2 hours. Thus, each of the tapered roller bearings produced using sample 1 had a rolling fatigue life improved twice or more as compared with that in each of the tapered roller bearings produced using sample 3.
