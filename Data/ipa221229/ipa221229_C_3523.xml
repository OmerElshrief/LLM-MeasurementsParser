<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates a method of depositing thin films, using a remotely generated plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to methods of depositing thin films onto substrates. More particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to a method of sputtering material from a target such that it is deposited as a thin film on a substrate, wherein the material is sputtered from the target by a remotely generated plasma, and upon deposition on to the substrate, the material directly forms a thin film with a crystalline structure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Plasma deposition systems are widely used in a range of industries, from electronic device manufacture to the production of hardwearing coatings. In the electronic device sector, there are a number of established plasma deposition technologies. These include DC sputtering, RF sputtering, pulsed DC sputtering, magnetron sputtering (DC, RF or pulsed DC), reactive sputtering, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PCT publication WO2011/131921A1 discloses a method of using a remotely generated plasma, and guiding said plasma onto the target in such a way that there is uniform sputtering of the target material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, WO2011/131921A1 is not concerned with the deposition of crystalline thin-films at all, and certainly not the deposition of thin-films in situ. It does not discuss, or anticipate, a method of how to deposit a crystalline film in situ through manipulation of certain parameters of a thin film deposition system that utilises a remotely generated plasma. Additionally, WO(2011/131921A1 does not discuss a plasma/target geometric arrangement that allows for achieving the preservation of stoichiometry between a target material and a thin film formed through sputter deposition of said target.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">CN105821378 discloses a method of forming crystalline film of antimony doped tin oxide on a substrate using a remotely generated plasma. Whilst this document discloses this process occurring at relatively low temperatures, it should be noted that this is enabled by the relatively low energy crystal structure of antimony doped tin oxide, and is therefore not relevant when discussing the formation of the high-energy crystal structure required by LiCoO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Whilst the techniques that comprise the state of the art are capable of producing thin films of high quality material, there remains a long felt need for an ability to produce crystalline films of highly ordered material, such as layered oxide materials, at temperatures sufficiently low to allow the use of a wide range of substrate materials and thicknesses.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0014">The applicant has discovered that it is possible to form films of cathode material directly onto substrates. In &#x201c;directly&#x201d;, what is meant is that the film forms a film with substantially no annealing step. The method has been shown to work on a wide range of substrate materials. The applicant has discovered that the method is particularly effective for depositing crystalline alkali and alkaline earth metal-based cathode materials, such as lithium-based cathode layers. The applicant has discovered that it is possible to deposit a layer of cathode by generating a plasma remote from one or more suitable targets, use the plasma to generate sputtered material from the target(s), and deposit sputtered material into the substrate to form a layer of cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The sputter target and substrate together define a deposition space in which the plasma can be generated and confined such that maximum efficiencies in generation and utilisation of the plasma can be achieved. In examples, the plasma is generated and confined in said deposition space (i.e. between the sputter target and substrate) to enhance and achieve industrial-scale deposition and full target utilisation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">The layer of cathode may be suitable for a battery cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The layer of cathode may be ordered and may, for example, be crystalline.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The cathode material of the layer of cathode may comprise one or more alkali metals, such as lithium. The cathode material may comprise oxygen, and may comprise an oxide or phosphate, for example. The cathode material may comprise one or more transition metals, optionally more than one transition metal. The one or more transition metal may be in period 4 or period 5 of the Periodic Table. The one or more transition metal may be selected from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, V, Nb and Ti, and may optionally be selected from the group consisting of CO, Ni and Mn. The cathode material may comprise one or more alkali metal, one or more transition metal and (each of which is selected from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, V, Nb and Ti, and optionally from the group consisting of Co, Ni and Mn), and optionally another metal not being an alkali metal or a transition metal (such as aluminium). The cathode material may be an oxide or phosphate, and may comprise lithium and at least one transition metal, and optionally more than one transition metal, each transition metal being selected from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, V, Nb and Ti, and optionally from the group consisting of Co, Ni and Mn. The cathode material may be an oxide or phosphate, and may consist of oxygen (in the case of an oxide) or phosphate (in the case of a phosphate), in combination with lithium and at least one transition metal, and optionally more than one transition metal, each transition metal being selected from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, V, Nb and Ti, and optionally from the group consisting of Co, Ni and Mn, and optionally aluminium.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0027">The substrate may comprise polymer. The substrate may be flexible. The substrate may comprise polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). PEN and PET are reasonably flexible, and relatively high tensile strength due to their semi-crystalline structure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0028">The method may comprise depositing cathode material on a first portion of the substrate. The method may comprise moving the substrate, and depositing sputtered material on a second portion of substrate, thereby forming cathode material on the second portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0029">This facilitates the reasonably rapid production of relatively large areas of cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0030">The substrate may comprise, or be in the form of, a sheet or web, optionally an elongate sheet or web. Such a sheet or web may be provided in the form of a roll or stack. Preferably, the substrate is provided as a roll. This facilitates simple and safe storage and handling of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0031">The substrate may be movably mounted to facilitate movement of the substrate (optionally in the form of a sheet). The substrate may be mounted in a roll-to-roll arrangement. Substrate upstream of the plasma deposition process may be held on roller or drum. Substrate downstream of the plasma deposition process may be held on a roller or drum. This facilitates simple and rapid handling of flexible sheets of substrate. A shutter may be provided to allow for a portion of the substrate to be exposed to the remotely generated plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0032">The use of a roll-to-roll arrangement has a number of advantages. It facilitates a high material throughput and allows a large cathode area to be deposited on one large substrate, though a series of depositions at a first portion of the substrate, followed by a second portion of the substrate, and so on. One of the main benefits of a roll-to-roll processing is that it allows for a number of depositions to occur without breaking vacuum. This saves both time and energy compared to systems in which the chamber needs to be taken to back up to atmospheric pressure from vacuum after deposition, in order to load a new substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0033">The plasma deposition process optionally takes place in a chamber. The upstream drum or roller for carrying the substrate may be located inside or outside the chamber. The downstream drum or roller for carrying the substrate may be located inside or outside the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0034">The substrate may optionally not exceed its temperature corrected yield strength at any point as it passes between the upstream and downstream rollers or drums. This is important as roll-to-roll processing machines require the substrate to be in tension as the substrate is fed through various rolls, rollers and drums. If the substrate comprises a polymer, then as the polymer heats up, its yield strength may begin to lower. If the polymer increases in temperature too much, the polymer may begin to deform as it passes through the roll-to-roll machine. This can lead to buckles, jams, and uneven deposition onto the substrate. Preferably, the temperature of the substrate does not exceed 200 degrees at any point during the plasma deposition process, or as it passes between the upstream and downstream rollers or drums.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0035">One or more target(s) may optionally comprise the cathode material that forms the layer of cathode. Using a target of the cathode material helps preserve stoichiometry during the deposition process. This ceramic target is also more resilient to ultra-high vacuum (10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>mbar or lower) than elemental lithium, and will not sublime at these pressures. Being able to run the system at a stronger vacuum is advantageous as it allows for a higher deposition rate.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0036">One or more target(s) may optionally comprise a distinct region of elemental first metal (such as lithium), and a distinct region of elemental second metal (such as cobalt).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0037">A &#x201c;distinct region&#x201d; can mean either its own target, or an area of a target. A single target which comprises multiple distinct regions of different first metal and/or second metal species can be referred to as a composite target.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0038">One or more target(s) optionally comprise a distinct region of first elemental metal (such as lithium), a distinct region of second elemental metal (such as cobalt), a distinct region of an oxide of the first metal (such as lithium oxide), a distinct region of an oxide of the second metal (such as cobalt oxide), a distinct region of first and second elemental metals (such as LiCo), a distinct region of the cathode material (such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>), or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0039">Oxide targets or mixed elemental targets (e.g. lithium oxide, cobalt oxide, LiCo and LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) are useful targets to use as they are far less expensive than their elemental metal counterparts. They are also more environmentally stable, and are easier to handle in an industrial environment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0040">The method may also optionally comprise the sputtering of material under a reactive sputtering regime, using a reactive gas, such as oxygen, nitrogen, ozone or ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0041">In a reactive sputtering method, a reactive gas is provided, along with the inert sputter gas. This allows elemental targets to be used, and oxides to form as part of the plasma sputtering process. Generally, the structure and form of the oxide produced may be adjusted, by providing the reactive oxygen gas at a higher or lower flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0042">The thickness of the deposited cathode material on completion of the method is optionally no more than 10 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0043">The thickness of the substrate is optionally no more than 1.6 microns. The thickness of the substrate provided is optionally less than 1.0 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0044">It is beneficial when designing solid state batteries for the substrate to be as thin as possible. This allows for batteries with a higher energy density to be manufactured. Preferably, if a thinner substrate became available, which met the necessary requirements of a relatively high temperature corrected yield strength and high degradation point, this substrate would be used for the method.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0045">At least a portion of and optionally all of the deposited material may have a hexagonal crystal structure. If the cathode material comprises LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, for example, the crystal structure of the LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>which is deposited is optionally in the R3(bar)m space group.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0046">The R<o ostyle="single">3</o>m space group structure is a layered oxide structure. This structure has a number of benefits, such as having a high usable capacity and high speed of charging and discharging compared to the low energy structure of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, which has a structure in the Fd3m space group. The R<o ostyle="single">3</o>m space group is regarded as having better performance in typical battery applications due to enhanced reversibility and fewer structural changes on lithium intercalation and deintercalation. Therefore crystalline LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>in the R<o ostyle="single">3</o>m space group is favoured for solid state battery applications.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0047">During the deposition part of the method, the crystals may optionally grow substantially epitaxially from the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0048">Epitaxial growth is favoured as it allows for lithium ions to intercalate and deintercalate more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0049">The crystals are optionally aligned with the (101) and (110) planes substantially parallel to the substrate. At least a portion of and optionally all of the deposited material may have a hexagonal crystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0050">The target optionally has a power density associated with the bias applied to it of at least 1.0 Wcm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>. Such a power density has been found to be effective in order for the sputtering threshold to be passed, the target material to sputter.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0051">The power density associated with the bias applied to the target is optionally up to 100 Wcm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0052">The temperature experienced by the first portion or second portion of the substrate during the manufacturing process optionally does not exceed the degradation temperature of the substrate material.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0053">The ratio of the power supplied to generate the remote plasma to the power associated with the bias of the target is optionally more than 1:1.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0054">The inventors have found that surprisingly, above this ratio, that thin films of cathode material, such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, form crystalline structure directly in situ on the film.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0055">In the system where this was found by the inventors, the efficiency of the power source used to generate the remote plasma was taken to be 50%. In this connection, the efficiency of the generation of the plasma ([actual power in the plasma/power used to generate the plasma]&#xd7;100). The efficiency of the generation of the plasma may be anywhere between 50% and 85%. It may be the case that this ratio is adjusted, such that it is &#x201c;normalised&#x201d; with respect to efficiency. For example, in the case where the efficiency of the generation of the plasma is actually 85%, the normalised efficiency of the plasma would be [(1&#xd7;0.5)/0.85=approx. 0.6] approximately 0.6:1.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0056">The ratio of the power supplied to generate the remote plasma to the power associated with the bias of the target is optionally no more than 7:2. This is under the assumption that the efficiency of the generation of the plasma is taken to be 50%, and this ratio may or may not be normalised as previously described, if the efficiency of the generation of the plasma is greater or lower than 50%. The means of powering the plasma source may be of RF, DC, or pulsed-DC type.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0057">The ratio of the power supplied to generate the remote plasma to the power associated with the bias of the target is optionally no more than 3:2. This is under the assumption that the efficiency of the generation of the plasma is taken to be 50%, and this ratio may or may not be normalised as previously described, if the efficiency of the generation of the plasma is greater or lower than 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0058">Optionally, the maximum temperature reached at any given time by any given square of substrate material having an area of 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>as measured on the surface opposite to said surface on which the material is deposited and as averaged over a period of 1 second, is less than 500&#xb0; C., optionally no more than 300&#xb0; C., optionally no more than 200 degrees C., optionally no more than 190 degrees C., optionally no more than 180 degrees C., optionally no more than 170 degrees C., optionally no more than 160 degrees C. and optionally no more than 150 degrees C.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0059">If there are one or more targets comprising regions of second elemental metal (such as cobalt) or oxide thereof, and one or more targets comprising regions of first elemental metal (such as lithium) or oxide thereof, then optionally the targets comprising regions of second elemental metal or oxide thereof are angled such that their angle of incidence in relation to the plane defined by the surface of the remotely generated plasma is greater than that of targets comprising regions of first elemental metal or oxide thereof. Optionally, the targets comprising regions of second elemental metal or oxide thereof and the targets comprising regions of first elemental metal or oxide thereof are arranged such that ions of the first and second metals are sputtered at substantially the same rate. This is beneficial, as it helps targets made of different materials to be depleted at the same rate, allowing the targets to be replaced at the same time. This may result in less waste from only partially utilised targets.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0060">Optionally, the geometry of the surface defined by the remotely generated plasma is curved, at a location substantially near to the one or more targets. This optionally allows for tuning the sputter rate of individual targets in an angled target assembly. A curved plasma facilitates some control over the amount of interaction between the target and plasma, depending on the angle of orientation of the target. This is possible because curving the plasma allows for targets at a non-zero angle (i.e. titled angle) in relation to the plane defined by the plasma if the plasma profile was flat, to be exposed to a higher density of plasma, and therefore to sputter at a higher rate. This can be tuned, such that curving the plasma more or less resulting in submerging the target in a lower or higher density of plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0061">Plumes of material may optionally be sputtered from targets. These plumes may optionally overlap. For example, a first plume sputtered from a first target may overlap with a second plume sputtered from a second target. The first target may comprise lithium for example and the second target may comprise cobalt. The plumes may overlap such that the first portion of the substrate is coated with both the first and second plumes of material.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0062">The substrate optionally comprises a current collecting layer. The current collecting layer may comprise an electrically-conductive material, such as an inert metal. The current collecting layer may be platinum. The current collecting layer may have a modified structure to increase its surface area. The current collecting layer may also act as an anode. The cathode material (such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) may be deposited onto the current collecting layer. The substrate may be provided with an adhesion promoter layer immediately beneath the current collecting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0063">The working distance between the target and the substrate may be within +1-50% of the theoretical mean free path of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0064">Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the working distance has an influence on the &#x201c;ad atom&#x201d; energy of the sputtered material as it deposits onto the substrate. In a case where the working distance is greater than the mean free path of the system, it is thought that it is more likely that an ion in the sputter flux would be involved in a collision before reaching the substrate, resulting in relatively low ad atom energy. Conversely, if the working distance is shorter than the mean free path of the system, the ad atom energy is relatively high.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0065">A definition of the mean free path is the average distance between collisions for an ion in the plasma. The mean free path is calculated based on the volume of interaction (varied by the working distance), and the number of molecules per unit volume (varied by the working pressure).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0066">The working distance is optionally at least 3.0 cm, optionally at least 4.0 cm and optionally 5.0 cm. The working distance is optionally no more than 20 cm, optionally no more than 15 cm and optionally no more than 13 cm. The working distance may be from 4.0 cm to 13 cm, optionally from 6.0 cm to 10 cm, and optionally from 8.0 cm to 9.0 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0067">The working pressure may be from 0.00065 to 0.01 mBar, and optionally from 0.0010 mBar to 0.0065 mBar. A higher working pressure in this range may result in a higher deposition rate. This is because a higher working pressure results in a larger number of process ion (usually Ar+) bombardments on the surface of the target, and hence material is sputtered from the target at a higher rate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0068">When the working distance is from 8.0 to 9.0 cm, the range of crystallite sizes available may be narrower, for example, if a working pressure of from 0.0010 mBar to 0.0065 mBar is used. The crystallite size may be from 14 to 25 nm. This is evidence that within these parameter ranges, it is possible to form films with narrow and predictable thin film ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0069">The surface onto which the layer of cathode is deposited may have a surface roughness Xs or less, where Xs=100 nm, and the cathode layer may have a thickness of from 0.01 to 10 &#x3bc;m and a surface roughness of no more than Xi, where Xi equals the product of F and Xs, where F is a factor in the range of 1 to 2.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0070">Xs may be no more than 10% of the thickness of the substrate. The product of the thickness of the substrate and Xs may be no more than 10<sup>5 </sup>nm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0071">The substrate, optionally a polymer substrate, may be provided with embedded particles and of all of the embedded particles within or on the polymer material, the majority of those that contribute to surface roughness of the substrate have a median size from 10% to 125% of Xs.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0137" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic side-on view of a plasma deposition process apparatus which is used in a method of depositing a (crystalline) material onto a substrate in accordance with a first example. The method is denoted generally by reference numeral <b>1001</b> and is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>, and comprises generating <b>1002</b> a plasma remote from one or more targets, exposing <b>1003</b> the plasma target or targets to the plasma such that target material is sputtered from one or more targets, and exposing <b>1004</b> a first portion of a substrate to sputtered material such that the sputtered material is deposited onto the first portion of the substrate, thereby forming crystalline material onto the first portion of the substrate. The method of depositing a (crystalline) material onto the substrate may be performed as a part of a method of manufacturing a battery cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0132">The crystalline material in this example takes the form ABO<sub>2</sub>. In the present example, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material takes a layered oxide structure. In the present example, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material is LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. However, the method of the present example has been shown to work on a wide range of ABO<sub>2 </sub>materials. In other examples, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material structure comprises at least one of the following compounds (described here with non-specific stoichiometry): LiCoO, LiCoAlO, LiNiCoAlO, LiMnO, LiNiMnO, LiNiMnCoO, LiNiO and LiNiCoO. These materials are potential candidates for manufacturing a battery cathode. Those skilled in the art will realise that the stoichiometry may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0133">In this example, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material is LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>and is deposited as a layer that is approximately 1 micron thick. In other examples, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material is deposited as layer that is approximately 5 microns thick. In yet further examples, the ABO<sub>2 </sub>material is deposited as a layer that is approximately 10 microns thick.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0134">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the plasma deposition process apparatus is denoted generally by reference numeral <b>100</b> and comprises a plasma target assembly <b>102</b> comprising a target <b>104</b>, a remote plasma generator <b>106</b>, a series of electromagnets <b>108</b> for confining the plasma generated by the remote plasma generator <b>106</b>, a target power supply <b>110</b>, a remote plasma source power supply <b>112</b> and a housing <b>114</b>. Remote plasma generator <b>106</b> comprises two pairs of radio frequency (RF) antennae <b>116</b>. Housing <b>114</b> comprises a vacuum outlet <b>120</b> which is connected to a series of vacuum pumps located outside the chamber so that the chamber <b>122</b> defined by housing <b>114</b> can be evacuated. Housing <b>114</b> is also provided with a gas inlet <b>124</b> which may be connected to a gas supply (not shown) for the introduction of one or more gases into the chamber <b>122</b>. In other examples, the gas inlet <b>124</b> may be positioned over the surface of the target assembly <b>102</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the plasma is generated remote from the target <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0135">In this example, the target <b>104</b> comprises material LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. Briefly, the chamber <b>122</b> is evacuated until a sufficiently low pressure is reached. Power provided by power supply <b>112</b> is used to power the remote plasma generator <b>106</b> to generate a plasma. Power is applied to the target <b>104</b> such that plasma interacts with target <b>104</b>, causing LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>to be sputtered from the target <b>104</b> and onto the substrate <b>128</b>. In the present example, the substrate <b>128</b> comprises a polymer sheet which is introduced into the housing <b>114</b> via inlet <b>130</b> and out of the housing <b>114</b> via outlet <b>132</b>. A powered roller <b>134</b> is used to help move the substrate <b>128</b>. The LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited onto the substrate <b>128</b> as a crystalline (non-amorphous) material.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0136">The apparatus <b>100</b> also comprises a shutter <b>136</b>, for restricting deposition of sputtered material onto the substrate <b>128</b>, and an input <b>138</b> for cooling the drum. Shutter <b>136</b> allows a portion of the substrate <b>128</b> to be exposed to the sputtered material.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0137">As mentioned above, a powered roller <b>134</b> is used to help move the substrate <b>128</b> into and out of the plasma deposition apparatus <b>100</b>. Powered roller <b>134</b> is part of a roll-to-roll substrate handling apparatus (not shown) which comprises at least a first storage roller upstream of the plasma deposition apparatus <b>100</b> and a second storage roller downstream of the plasma deposition apparatus <b>100</b>. The roll-to-roll substrate handling apparatus is a convenient way of handling, storing and moving thin, flexible substrates such as the polymer substrate used in this example. Such a roll-to-roll system has a number of other advantages. It allows for a high material throughput and allows a large cathode area to be deposited on one substrate, throughout a series of depositions at a first portion of the substrate, followed by a second portion of the substrate, and so on. Furthermore, such roll-to-roll processing allows for a number of depositions to occur without breaking vacuum. This saves both time and energy compared to systems in which the chamber needs to be taken back up to atmospheric pressure from vacuum after deposition in order to load a new substrate. In other examples, sheet-to-sheet processing is used instead of roll-to-roll processing, wherein the substrate is provided with a support. Alternatively, the substrate may be supplied in discrete sheets that are handled and stored in relatively flat sheets. The substrate may be planar in shape as the material is deposited thereon. This may be the case, when the substrate is provided in the form of discrete sheets, not being transferred to or from a roll. The sheets may each be mounted on a carrier, having greater structural rigidity. This may allow for thinner substrates to be used than in the case of substrate film held on a roller. It may be that the substrate is a sacrificial substrate. It may be that the substrate is removed before the layer(s) of material. Part or all of the substrate may be removed before integrating the crystalline layer or a part thereof in an electronic product package, component or other end product. For example, the layer of crystalline material may be lifted off from the substrate. There may be a layer of other intervening material between the base substrate and the crystalline material. This layer may lift off with the crystalline material or assist in the separation of the crystalline material from the base substrate. A laser-based lift-off technique may be used. The substrate may be removed by a process that utilises laser ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0138">Similar techniques are described in the prior art. For example, KR20130029488 describes a method of making a battery including using a sacrificial substrate and laser radiation to harvest a battery layer. In other examples, another suitable processing regime is used, provided it is capable of sufficiently high production throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0139">The polymer substrate <b>128</b> is under tension when moving through the system, for example withstanding a tension of at least 0.001N during at least part of the processing. The polymer is robust enough such that when the polymer is fed through the roll-to-roll machine, it does not experience deformation under tensile stress. In this example, the polymer is Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and the substrate <b>128</b> has a thickness of 1 micron or less, in examples the thickness is 0.9 microns. The substrate <b>128</b> is pre-coated with a current collecting layer, which is made of an inert metal. In this example, the inert metal used as the current collecting layer is platinum. The yield strength of the PET film is sufficiently strong that the substrate does not yield or plastically deform under the stresses of the roll-to-roll handling apparatus. The inert metal used in other examples can alternatively be gold, iridium, copper, aluminium or nickel.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0140">The use of such thin polymer substrates is beneficial because this facilitates batteries with a higher energy density to be manufactured. In other examples, a material, which is not polymeric, is used, providing that it can be manufactured in a sufficiently thin and flexible manner to allow for a high battery density and ease of handling post-deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0141">The plasma deposition process and subsequent manufacturing processes are however subject to the technical challenges that working with such thin layers impose.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0142">Before the substrate <b>128</b> is so pre-coated, it has a surface roughness that is carefully engineered so as (a) to be great enough to mitigate the undesirable effects that would otherwise result from electrostatic forces (such as increasing the force required to unwind the polymer film from the drum on which it is held) and (b) to be small enough that the roughness does not cause problems when depositing material onto the substrate. In this example, the surface roughness is engineered to be about 50 nm. It will be noted that the product of the thickness of the substrate (0.9 microns) and the surface roughness is 4.5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>nm<sup>2 </sup>and is therefore less than 10<sup>5 </sup>nm<sup>2 </sup>and less than 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>nm<sup>2 </sup>in this example. It has been found that that the roughness needed for easing handling of thin films rises with decreasing thickness. Generally, it has been found that the roughness required to improve handling of thinner substrates (i.e. less than 10 microns, particularly less than 1 micron) increases as the substrate thickness decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows (not to scale) a typical thin-film polymer being about 1 micron thick and having embedded particles providing roughness. The roughness of the surface features provided by the particles is at least 90 nm and possibly higher. This is too rough for the particular example envisaged (although may be acceptable for other examples).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d </i></figref>shows (not to scale) one way in which the desired roughness can be achieved. Spherical particles of polystyrene are embedded in the substrate material such that at least 90% of those which contribute to the roughness of the substrate protrude from the local substrate surface by no more than half the volume of the particle. The particles have a diameter of about 90 nm. Thus, a majority of the embedded particles that contribute to surface roughness of the substrate have a median size of about 180% of the surface roughness of the substrate. In other examples, the embedded spherical particles are made of different material, such as silicon oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>shows (not to scale) an alternative way in which a desired roughness can be achieved. Spherical embedded particles of polystyrene are present on the surface of the substrate material such that at least 90% of those which contribute to the roughness of the substrate protrude from the local substrate surface by more than half the volume of the particle. The particles used in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>are smaller than those used in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0146">Examples such as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>d </i>and <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>enable good quality films to be deposited, as crystalline material, on thin substrates in a manufacturing environment. The advantages of the presence of embedded particles are retained, but by careful control of the location and size distribution of such particles, the potential disadvantages can be avoided or reduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>f </i>to <b>1</b><i>h </i></figref>show schematically a cross-section corresponding to the substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>e </i></figref>after a layer of crystalline material has been formed on the substrate surface. The intermediate layer of metal current collector is omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>f </i>to <b>1</b><i>h</i></figref>. The roughness of the substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>c </i>and <b>1</b><i>f </i></figref>is such that problems arise. The dominating protrusions caused by certain embedded particles <b>152</b> cause shadowing and competing crystal growth, which are illustrated schematically by means of the contrasting shading <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>. This competing crystal growth which is aligned in a conflicting direction gives rise to discontinuities in the layer that affects performance of the final product. Also, there is a surprisingly profound effect on the likelihood of delamination of the layer of deposited material from the substrate. This may be as a result of poor contact between the deposited layer and the underlying substrate in the region near to any embedded particles that protrude far from the median plane of the surface (illustrated schematically by the voids <b>156</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>f</i></figref>), where the local asperity radius is small In contrast, it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>g </i>and <b>1</b><i>h </i></figref>that no such problems arise. The roughness of the surface of the material deposited on the substrate is approximately 50 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0154" num="0148">This instrument has a stationary stylus. The surface to be measured is translated under the stylus, and the deflections of the stylus measure the surface profile, from which various roughness parameters are calculated.</p>

<p id="p-0181" num="0170">In Table 1 above, the elemental film composition was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using a Themo Fisher K-alpha spectrometer with a MAGCIS ion gun. Quoted compositions were taken from depth profiling measuring at about 10 levels with a film. Plasma source power is the electrical power supplied to generate the plasma. Sputtering power is the electrical power applied to the target <b>204</b>. Process pressure is the pressure in the chamber. Film thickness and roughness measurements were taken after deposition, using an Omniscan MicroXAM 5000b 3d optical profiler. Film thicknesses were measured after deposition, as step-heights at masked edges and roughness measurements were taken from sample areas of about 400 microns&#xd7;500 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows an X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the battery cathode of Sample 1. The structure of the film was characterised by X-ray diffraction using a diffractometer (Rigaku-Smartlab) with nickel filtered CuK&#x3b1; radiation (&#x3bb;=1.5406 &#x212b;). The diffraction pattern was taken at room temperature in the range 10&#xb0;&#x3c;2 &#x3b8;&#x3c;80&#xb0; using a fixed incident angle of &#x3c;5&#xb0;. Data were collected using step scans with a resolution of 0.04&#xb0;/step and a count time of 0.5 s/step. The peak at approximately 37&#xb0; is associated with the (101) plane of the crystals being substantially orientated parallel to the substrate surface. The peak at approximately 66&#xb0; is associated with the crystals being substantially oriented such that the (110) plane is parallel to the substrate. The peak at approximately 55&#xb0; is associated with the glass substrate, and for the purposes of determining the crystal structure of the LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, should be ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0172">The absence of extra reflections associated with the Fd3m space group is an initial indicator that the LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>deposited is in the R<o ostyle="single">3</o>m, space group.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0173">Also notably absent is the peak associated with the (003) plane. This implies that very few crystals are orientated in such a way that the (003) plane is parallel to the substrate surface. It is beneficial that very few crystals are orientated in this way. A detailed explanation is beyond the scope of the present application, but briefly, the accessible capacity of a cathode increases when a higher proportion of the crystals are aligned such that the (101) and (110) planes are parallel to the substrate, as opposed to being aligned such that the (003) plane is parallel to the substrate as the apparent resistance to ion migration is lower. The crystals have formed such that the longitudinal axis of the crystals is normal to the substrate. In other words, the crystals have formed in an epitaxial manner.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0174">The applicant has discovered that if the ratio of the power used to generate the plasma to the power associated with the biasing of the target is more than 1:1, then generally a crystalline material is deposited. In Sample 1, the ratio is 1800:500 (3.6:1) and in Sample 2, the ratio is 1800:800 (9:4). Note that in this example, the ratio is calculated on the assumption that the power efficiency of the plasma-generating source is taken to be 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0175">In a comparative example, the experiment was repeated with a plasma source power of 1 kW and a power associated with bias to the target of 1 kW. The material deposited was substantially amorphous. The performance of the film of the comparative example as a cathode was investigated by depositing an electrolyte (in this case, LiPON) and an anode metal on top of the cathode layer, thereby making a solid state battery. The charge-discharge characteristics of the battery were investigated and were found to be poor, with a cathode specific capacity of about 10 mAh/g. When analogous batteries were made using crystalline LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>such as that formed in Sample 1 and Sample 2, the charge-discharge characteristics were far superior, with typical cathode specific capacities of about 120 mAh/g.</p>

The bonding environment of the films was characterised by Raman Spectrocopy. Raman spectra were collected using a JY Horiba LabRAM ARAMIS imaging confocal Raman microscope using 532 nm excitation. Note that the strong sharp peak at 600 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>can be considered as anomalous due to the unphysical nature of the sharpness of the peak. The strong, characteristic peak observed at 487 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is well known in the art to be associated with the R<o ostyle="single">3</o>m space group crystal structure of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>d</i></figref>, the relative intensity of the peak at approximately 66&#xb0; is far stronger than that of the peak at 37&#xb0;. This indicates that the number of crystals with their (110) planes parallel to the substrate is higher than the number of crystals with their (101) planes parallel to the substrate for Sample 2. This is beneficial as it means that the ion channels of the thin film are orientated perpendicular to the substrate, making for easier for intercalation and de-intercalation of the ions from their interstitial sites from within the crystal structure of the cathode. This improves the accessible capacity and the rate of charge of the cathode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>e </i></figref>is a Raman spectra of the cathode of Sample 2; the same comments apply to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>e </i></figref>that apply to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>c. </i></p>

The plasma is confined and focused by a magnetic field controlled by two pairs of electromagnets <b>308</b>, each pair being positioned proximate to one of the antennae <b>316</b> and the electric field generated by the system. The overall shape of the plasma (the 90% highest concentration of which being illustrated in highly schematic fashion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>by the plasma cloud B&#x2033;) is that of a blanket, in that the length and width of the plasma cloud are much greater than the thickness. The width of the plasma is controlled in part by the length of the antennae <b>316</b>. The two pairs of antennae <b>316</b> are separated by a distance that is comparable to the length of the plasma. The length and width of the plasma are in the same general direction as the length and width, respectively, of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0180">The plasma source is spaced apart from the targets, and may thus be considered as a remotely generated plasma. The theoretical mean free path of the system (that is, the average distance between collisions for an ion in the plasma) is about 12 cm, meaning that the majority of particles travel from the target to the substrate without colliding with any argon ions in the plasma.</p>

The first and second directions converge towards the substrate and intersect at a location just beyond the substrate (the location being about 3 cm beyond the substrate). Oxygen gas is supplied at a controlled rate into the process chamber <b>322</b> through inlets <b>325</b>. The targets are stationary as the substrate moves with rotation of the drum.

The first target also has a slightly larger surface area exposed to the plasma than the sum area of the second targets. As such, the number of ionised Li atoms arriving at the substrate per unit is substantially the same as the number of ionised Co atoms arriving at the substrate per unit.

The theoretical mean free path of the system (that is, the average distance between collisions for an ion in the plasma) is about 20 cm. For each pair of targets (<b>302</b>), in use there is a first plume of particles from the first target (<b>304</b>) and a second plume of particles from the second target (<b>303</b>) which converge at a region proximate to the substrate. The centre of rotation of the main drum <b>334</b> is also the centre of rotation of the targets. The targets move with an angular velocity about the centre of rotation slower than the drum. Targets may be replaced when they have moved out of the plasma on a rotating basis, thus allowing for constant deposition of material on the moving substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0225" num="0230">In this example, the method comprises depositing a second semiconducting layer of material, onto the first semiconducting layer of material. In other examples, the second semi-conducting layer of material is deposited directly onto the substrate or the intermediate layer (if present). In this example, the second semiconducting layer of material is an intrinsic semiconductor. In this example, the second semiconducting layer of material is gallium nitride. In further examples, the second semiconducting layer of material is doped n-type with dopants such as phosphorous, arsenic, antimony, bismuth or lithium. In some further examples, the second semiconducting layer of material is doped p-type, with dopants such as boron, aluminium, gallium or indium. In some of these examples, the dopant material is not introduced as a target that can be sputtered, and is instead introduced as a gas after deposition, such that the dopant diffuses into the surface of the semiconducting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0231">In this example, the method comprises depositing a third semiconducting layer of material. In this example, the third semiconducting layer is deposited onto the second semi-conducting layer of material. In other examples, the third semiconducting layer is deposited directly onto the first semiconducting layer, second semiconducting layer, the intermediate layer or the substrate. In this example, the third semiconducting layer comprises silicon. In other examples, the third semiconducting layer comprises aluminium, and in some further examples, gallium nitride. In some examples where the semiconducting layer of material is gallium nitride, the deposition occurs under a reactive nitrogen atmosphere. In this example, the third semiconducting layer of material is doped p-type. This is achieved in this example by sputtering of a target comprising a compound containing boron. In other examples, this is achieved by use of a different dopant such as aluminium, gallium or indium. In some further examples, the third semiconducting layer of material is doped n-type, with dopants such as phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth or lithium. In further examples, the third semiconducting layer of material is not doped, and is an intrinsic semi-conductor. In some of these examples, the dopant material is not introduced as a target, which can be sputtered, and is instead introduced as a gas after deposition, such that the dopant diffuses into the surface of the semiconducting layer.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0233">In this example, no further dopants are introduced into some of the semiconducting layers hitherto described. In some examples, germanium is introduced as a dopant in the first, second and/or third layers. Germanium alters the band gap of the electronic device, and improves the mechanical properties of each semiconducting layer of material. In some examples, nitrogen is introduced as a dopant in the first, second and/or third layers of material. Nitrogen is used to improve the mechanical properties of the semiconducting layers formed.</p>

<p id="p-0241" num="0246">The high target utilisation that the current method provides is beneficial when constructing electronic devices from rare elements such as dysprosium. Dysprosium is available in limited Earth abundancy, and so a deposition system with a high target utilisation results in less material waste.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0247">According to a sixteenth example, a method of manufacturing a layer of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is presented, which will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.
