<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns a lance for immersion of a probe into molten metal contained in a metallurgical vessel, such as a converter for making steel. The lance is of the type comprising a top lance, which is reusable and does not contact the molten metal, and a sublance coupled to the top lance and holding at a free end thereof a probe for measuring parameters of the molten metal, and/or a sampling tool for collecting a sample of molten metal. In use, the sublance is immersed partially into the molten metal and is disposable. The connection between the top lance and the sublance defines a shoulder, since the top lance has a larger diameter than the sublance. If molten metal splatters onto the shoulder of the top lance, it may, once solidified, jeopardize the coupling of a new sublance to the top lance. The present invention proposes a sublance provided with a protecting device preventing splattering of molten metal or slag onto the shoulder region of the top lance. To facilitate storing of the sublances in existing racks, and for handling the sublances by a robot without changing the programming of the robot, the protecting device stored in the rack has a diameter similar to the diameter of the sublance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Metal production processes are carried out in metallurgical vessels at high temperatures, undergoing chemical or physical reactions, whether desired or undesired, during the residence time or transfers from one vessel to another of molten metal and/or slag. Since the properties of the final metal products thus produced are strongly dependent on the process conditions, including temperature, pH, and on whether or not desired and undesired chemical or physical reactions occurred, it is important to measure such parameters and also to collect samples in situ, for further characterization. This is generally carried out with a lance comprising a top lance which remains out of the molten metal or slag and a sublance coupled to the top lance and provided with a probe and/or a sample collector at a free end thereof. The top lance is generally made of metal or polymer and is reusable. The sublance, on the other hand, is generally made of thick cardboard and is disposable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, steel can be produced from carbon-rich molten pig iron by an oxygen converter process, wherein oxygen is blown with a lance (<b>12</b>) through molten pig iron to lower the carbon content of the alloy and to change it into low-carbon steel (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In this process, samples are collected, and parameters of the melt measured with different sublances at least during oxygen blowing (sometimes referred to as inblow sublance) and after oxygen blowing (sometimes referred to as endblow sublance), to ensure that steel of the desired quality is obtained. The inblow sublances are typically provided with a sensor that can measure a temperature and a liquidus of the molten metal and with a sample collector for retrieving a sample of metal. The endblow sublances are typically provided with a sensor for measuring a temperature and an oxygen content of the molten metal and with a sample collector for retrieving a sample of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A new sublance is inserted over a coupling portion of the top lance until it reaches a shoulder formed by a handling portion of the top lance which has a diameter larger than the sublance. Because of vibrations during use, it is possible that the sublance loses contact with the shoulder forming a small gap. The molten metal (<b>11</b>) or the slag floating at the surface thereof can be agitated, either because a vessel is in movement or, in case of a steelmaking converter, because oxygen is being sparged, creating splatters (<b>11</b><i>s</i>) which can reach a top of the sublance and even the shoulder or, if there is one, a gap between said shoulder and the top of the sublance. The metal or slag splatters solidify and form incrustations at the surface of the shoulder and/or of the coupling portion at the level of the gap. When the current sublance is retrieved from the top lance and disposed of, it is important to scrape off any solid metal incrustation from the surfaces of the shoulder and coupling portion of the top lance lest a next sublance cannot be coupled properly to the top lance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,343 and EP3588052 describe solutions for preventing the formation of metal incrustations at a gap between the sublance and the shoulder. U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,343 describes an elastic ring seal between the immersion end of the shoulder of the top lance and the top of the sublance to reduce the deposition of frozen metal at the joint between the top lance and the sublance. EP3588052 describes a similar solution, using two elastic ring seals arranged at the end portion of the sublance, wherein the two elastic ring seals are arranged circumferentially on top of each other for sealing a space between the coupling tap and the end portion of the sublance. These solutions protect a gap between the sublance and the shoulder from being reached by metal or slag splatters. As mentioned supra, a gap does not necessarily occur, and these solutions do not protect the shoulder from metal splattering.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">KR101597688 proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of the top lance from metal splattering. The top end of the sublance is provided with an anti-stick cover formed by an inner ring comprising an inner passage suitable for engaging into the coupling portion of the top lance, and an outer ring, coaxial with and separate from the inner ring, having a larger diameter than the inner ring, which matches the diameter of the shoulder and protects it from metal splattering. The problem with this solution is that the outer ring has a diameter substantially larger than the diameter of the sublance. It follows that the racks traditionally used for storing new sublances awaiting their utilization cannot be used anymore without amending the dimensions of the receiving means to match the dimensions of the anti-stick covers. Furthermore, the change of the geometry of the top end of the sublance with the coupling of the anti-stick cover may require a change in the programming of the robots used for handling the sublances and for coupling them to or retrieving them from the top lance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention proposes a solution for protecting the shoulder of a top lance as well as any gap formed between said shoulder and a sublance, maintaining the geometry of the top of the sublance substantially unamended. This solution has the advantage that it can be implemented by replacing one-to-one existing sublances without requiring any design change of the existing racks used for storing the sublances and with no programming change of the robots used to handle the sublances. The solution has the advantage that the conformance of the protecting device to a surface of the top lance and conformance to a surface of the sublance is the result of the deformation of the entire device, rather than the deformation of a surface of an elastic material.&#x201d; and &#x201c;This solution has the advantage that the expandable radially protective device expands only after the top lance and sublance have been joined axially, thus reducing the possibility of damage during handling and assembly. These and other advantages of the present invention are presented in continuation.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0073">The present invention concerns a lance for immersion of a probe into molten metal. The lance comprises a top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) and a disposable sublance (<b>2</b>), holding a probe and being coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0074">The top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) comprises a handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) which is reusable, and a coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) coupled to or at least partially integral with a distal end of the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>). The handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) extends along a longitudinal axis (X) and comprises a distal end which is generally of substantially circular cross-section normal to the longitudinal axis (X) of diameter (D<b>1</b>). The distal end is provided with the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>), which extends coaxially with the longitudinal axis (X), and has a maximum diameter (d<b>1</b>), with D<b>1</b>&#x3e;d<b>1</b>. The coupling portion is generally formed by,
<ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0075">a fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) fixed to or integral with the distal end of the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) and defining an exposed area of the distal end forming a shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>), and a probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) extending along the longitudinal axis (X) and comprising a proximal end reversibly coupled to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0076">A given probe holder can be used a number of times without replacement, but because of the severe conditions of use it is exposed to, it degrades rapidly and, unlike the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) and the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>), the probe holder needs be replaced at regular intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0077">The sublance (<b>2</b>) is disposable and is formed by an elongated tube (<b>2</b><i>t</i>) extending along the longitudinal axis (X) and comprising a cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) configured for snugly receiving the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>). The cavity is substantially cylindrical of diameter (d<b>2</b>), with d<b>1</b>&#x3c;d<b>2</b>, extending along the longitudinal axis (X) from an immersion end provided with a probe (<b>2</b><i>p</i>) and/or a sample collector, to a proximal end which is coupled to a protective device (<b>3</b>) comprising a coupling end (<b>2</b><i>c</i>) opening to the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>). The elongated tube (<b>2</b><i>t</i>) has a substantially circular cross-section of external diameter (D<b>2</b>) wherein d<b>1</b>&#x3c;d<b>2</b>&#x3c;D<b>2</b>&#x3c;D<b>1</b>. The protective device (<b>3</b>) is deformable upon application thereto of a force along the longitudinal axis (X). The sublance (<b>2</b>) is reversibly coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) to form the lance. Coupling the sublance (<b>2</b>) to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) to form the lance of the present invention is achieved by inserting the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) of the sublance (<b>2</b>) with the coupling end (<b>2</b><i>c</i>) of the protective device (<b>3</b>) contacting the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0078">The gist of the present invention is to provide a protective device which, on the one hand,
<ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0021-0001" num="0079">does not alter substantially the geometry of the coupling end (<b>2</b><i>c</i>) of a separate (uncoupled) sublance, to allow using existing racks for storing the sublances and using robots without modifying the programming thereof and, on the other hand,</li>
        <li id="ul0021-0002" num="0080">covers and protects from splattering the whole area of the shoulder and of any gap formed between the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) and the sublance (<b>2</b>) when the latter is coupled to the former.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0081">This is achieved by designing the protective device such that
<ul id="ul0022" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0023" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0023-0001" num="0082">when at rest, the protective device (<b>3</b>) is in an initial configuration characterized by an outer maximum diameter (D<b>3</b><i>o</i>) which is not more than 10% larger than D<b>2</b> (D<b>3</b><i>o&#x2264;</i>1.1 D<b>2</b>), preferably not more than 5% larger than D<b>2</b> (D<b>3</b><i>o</i>1.05 D<b>2</b>), more preferably D<b>3</b><i>o</i>=D<b>2</b>, and</li>
        <li id="ul0023-0002" num="0083">when the sublance (<b>2</b>) is coupled to the lance with the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) being inserted in the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>), the protective device (<b>3</b>) contacts the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) and is deformed into a deformed configuration, forming a surface impervious to molten metal and slag, which spans over an area inscribing a circle normal to the longitudinal axis (X) of diameter (D<b>3</b><i>d</i>) with D<b>3</b>d&#x2265;D<b>1</b>; in the deformed configuration the protective device (<b>3</b>) covers a whole area of the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>), extending normal to the longitudinal axis (X) over a distance at least equal to &#xbd;D<b>1</b> from the longitudinal axis (X).</li>
    </ul>

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="2">Top Lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>)</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0084">The top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is a hollow rod, sufficiently long for being inserted into a metallurgic vessel. For example, for steelmaking converters, the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) can be 10 to 20 meters long, and even longer depending on the dimensions of the metallurgic installation. It is handled by a robot configured for pulling the lance down into and up out of a metallurgic vessel. The top lance is formed of a handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) and a coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0085">The handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) extends along a longitudinal axis (X) and comprises a distal end of substantially circular cross-section normal to the longitudinal axis (X) of diameter (D<b>1</b>). In a vast majority of cases, the cross-section of the distal end is circular, but in case it was not circular, the cross-section can be similarly characterized by a hydraulic diameter (Dh<b>1</b>) (not shown in the Figures) instead of the diameter (D<b>1</b>), wherein Dh<b>1</b>=A<b>1</b>/P<b>1</b>, with A<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b> being an area and a perimeter of the cross-section of the distal end normal to the longitudinal axis (X). The circularity of the cross-section of the distal end of the handling portion is not essential to the present invention. But in practice, it generally is circular.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0086">The handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) can be made of metal or polymer, or of a fibre reinforced polymer composite. It is designed to last over a substantial service time without being changed. It can be considered as an integral part of a metallurgic installation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) extends coaxially with the longitudinal axis (X), and has a maximum diameter (d<b>1</b>), with D<b>1</b>&#x3e;d<b>1</b>. A shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) of breadth (&#xbd; (D<b>1</b>&#x2212;d<b>1</b>)) is thus formed by the distal end of the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) and the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) is generally formed by,

    <ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0089">a fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) fixed to or integral with the distal end of the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>h</i>) and defining an exposed area of the distal end forming the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>), and</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0091">Like the handling portion, the coupling portion is generally hollow defining a passage for accommodating any wiring required by the probe (<b>2</b><i>p</i>) positioned ata free end of the sublance (<b>2</b>). A free end of the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) and, in particular, of the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>), can be provided with an electrical connection (<b>1</b><i>e</i>) (e.g., a male plug or a female socket) for coupling to a corresponding electrical connection (<b>2</b><i>e</i>) of any wiring of the probe (<b>2</b><i>b</i>) when a sublance (<b>2</b>) is coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>), thus forming an continuous electrically conductive communication extending from the probe (<b>2</b><i>p</i>) along the passage through the top lance to any controller for recording the measurements by the probe (<b>2</b><i>p</i>). Because the electrical connection (<b>1</b><i>e</i>) of the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) can be damaged by repeated connections/disconnections to new sublances (<b>2</b>) and by the severe working conditions within a metallurgical vessel, very close to molten metal at very high temperatures and often exposed to vibrations, the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) must be changed at regular intervals, to ensure a good connection of any wires.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0092">The probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) can be reversibly coupled to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) to form the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) by mechanical means, such as a thread as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, a bayonet, snap fits, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0098">An electrical connection (<b>2</b><i>e</i>) mating the electrical connection (<b>1</b><i>e</i>) of the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) of the top lance can be fixed at a corresponding position in the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>), such that when the sublance (<b>2</b>) is coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>), an electrical communication is formed by connecting the electrical connectors (<b>1</b><i>e</i>, <b>2</b><i>e</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) and of the sublance (<b>2</b>).

<p id="p-0064" num="0099">The elongated tube (<b>2</b><i>t</i>) is generally made of cardboard closed by the probe at the immersion end thereof.

<p id="p-0065" num="0100">The gist of the present invention includes the provision of a protective device (<b>3</b>) fixed to the coupling end of the sublance (<b>2</b>). At rest, the protective device has an initial configuration, which substantially does not alter the external geometrical dimensions of the sublance. The protective device (<b>3</b>) can be deformed into a deformed configuration upon application thereon of a force parallel to the longitudinal axis (X). The force for deforming the protective device (<b>3</b>) must not substantially exceed the force normally applied for coupling a sublance (<b>2</b>) to a top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>), and the protective device must be deformed from the initial configuration to the deformed configuration upon inserting the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) until a free end of the protective device (<b>3</b>) contacts the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) and, depending on the embodiments, upon deeper insertion of the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0101">Coupling of the various components of a lance (<b>1</b>) according to the present embodiment of the invention can include coupling the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) to form the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>). The probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) can be secured to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) with a screw thread, a bayonet, snap fits, and the like. The coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) can then be inserted coaxially into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) of the sublance (<b>2</b>), like a sword into a sheath until the protective device (<b>3</b>) in the initial configuration contacts the shoulder (<b>2</b><i>h</i>). Upon application of a force along the longitudinal axis (X) onto the protective device (<b>3</b>), the protective device reaches the deformed configuration.

In the initial configuration, the protective device has an outer maximum diameter (D<b>3</b><i>o</i>) yielding a perimeter Pi=&#x3c0;&#xd7;D<b>3</b><i>o</i>, formed by a number of stripes of material having a stripe width measured tangentially (i.e., normal to the longitudinal axis (X) and to a radial direction), defined between two adjacent slits of initial slit width.

Since the stripe width remains constant upon flexing the stripes of material, Pd can be larger than Pi only by accordingly increasing the slit width. The problem with locally broad slits (<b>3</b><i>si</i>, <b>3</b><i>so</i>) is that with such openings the surface thus formed cannot be impervious to splatters (<b>11</b><i>s</i>) of molten metal and slag. For this reason, both inner tube (<b>3</b><i>i</i>) and outer tube (<b>3</b><i>o</i>) are required with inner slits (<b>3</b><i>si</i>) and outer slits (<b>3</b><i>so</i>) which do not overlap with one another at any point so that any locally broad slit of the inner or the outer tube is always covered by a stripe of material of the outer or the inner tube, respectively, thus defining a surface impervious to splatters (<b>11</b><i>s</i>) of metal or slag.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> a screw thread is illustrated for coupling the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>).

At this stage, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the sublance (<b>2</b>) is not fully coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) yet.

By comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>d</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>, it can be seen that upon application of a compressive force along the longitudinal axis (X), the two-tube substantially cylindrical protective device buckles at mid-height (measured along the longitudinal axis (X)) forming a geometry of the type comprising two inverted funnels joined to one another at a broad end of each funnel. The diameter (D<b>3</b><i>d</i>) at the level of the folding of the stripes of materials must be at least equal to the diameter (D<b>2</b>) of the distal end of the top lance (D<b>3</b><i>d</i>&#x2265;D<b>2</b>).

Note that the sublance is generally stored, handled, and used with the longitudinal axis (X) being substantially vertical, so that the effects of gravity can easily be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0127">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the L-shaped plates are configured for pivoting about the hinges (<b>3</b><i>h</i>) from the initial configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> to the deformed configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref> upon inserting the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) to couple the sublance (<b>2</b>) to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>).

<p id="p-0093" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>6</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref> illustrate various steps for coupling of the various components of a lance according to the present embodiment of the invention, highlighting the deformation of the protective device (<b>3</b>) upon coupling the sublance (<b>2</b>) to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows how the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) is formed by coupling the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>) to form the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> a screw thread is illustrated for coupling the probe holder (<b>1</b><i>p</i>) to the fixed element (<b>1</b><i>f</i>). As discussed supra, other coupling means can be used without affecting the present invention, such as a bayonet, or snap fits. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) is inserted into the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>) of the sublance (<b>2</b>), like a sword into a sheath. In the initial configuration, the inner portions (<b>3</b><i>pi</i>) of the L-shaped plates (<b>3</b><i>p</i>) extend inwards radially, partially obturating the opening of the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>), leaving an opening of diameter lower than the diameter (d<b>1</b>) of the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>). Consequently, as the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) contacts the inner portions (<b>3</b><i>pi</i>) of the L-shaped plates (<b>3</b><i>p</i>), it applies a forces along the longitudinal axis (X) onto the inner portions, which pushes them downwards against the wall of the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>), thus driving the tilting of the L-shaped plates (<b>3</b><i>p</i>), lifting at the same time the outer portions (<b>3</b><i>po</i>) off the outer wall of the sublance (<b>2</b>). At the stage illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the protective device may or may not yet have reached the deformed configuration, depending on how far the inner portions (<b>3</b><i>pi</i>) are pushed against the wall of the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>). At this stage, the sublance (<b>2</b>) is not fully coupled to the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) yet, since the coupling end (<b>2</b><i>c</i>) thereof does not contact the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>). To complete the coupling, the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) must penetrate further, deeper into the cavity. It is essential to the present invention that the protective device (<b>3</b>) have reached the deformed configuration when coupling between the sublance (<b>2</b>) and the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>) is completed. To fully open the &#x201c;lotus flower&#x201d;, and bring the outer portions (<b>3</b><i>po</i>) side by side forming a continuous screen, the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) can be tapered, with the diameter of the coupling portion increasing until reaching the maximum diameter (d<b>1</b>) at a top section thereof, which is adjacent to the handling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>), to fully press the inner portions against the wall of the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>).</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="2">Conclusive Remarks</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0134">The various aspects of the present invention including a top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>), a sublance (<b>2</b>), and a protective device (<b>3</b>) have in common a protective device characterized in that,

    <ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0135">when at rest, the protective device (<b>3</b>) is in an initial configuration characterized by an outer maximum diameter (D<b>3</b><i>o</i>) which is not more than 10% larger than D<b>2</b> (D<b>3</b><i>o&#x2264;</i>1.1 D<b>2</b>), preferably not more than 5% larger than D<b>2</b> (D<b>3</b><i>o&#x2264;</i>1.05 D<b>2</b>), more preferably D<b>3</b><i>o</i>=D<b>2</b>,</li>
        <li id="ul0035-0002" num="0136">when the sublance (<b>2</b>) is coupled to the lance with the coupling portion (<b>1</b><i>c</i>) being inserted in the cavity (<b>2</b><i>v</i>), the protective device (<b>3</b>) contacts the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) and is deformed into a deformed configuration, forming a surface impervious to molten metal and slag, which spans over an area inscribing a circle of diameter (D<b>3</b><i>d</i>) with D<b>3</b><i>d</i>&#x2265;D<b>1</b>, covering a whole area of the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>), extending normal to the longitudinal axis (X) over a distance at least equal to &#xbd; D<b>1</b> from the longitudinal axis (X).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0137">This apparently simple solution yields great advantages in terms of maintenance of the lance, as there is no need to scrape off any solidified metal or slag splatter soiling the shoulder (<b>1</b><i>s</i>) of the top lance (<b>1</b><i>t</i>). At the same time, a sublance of the prior art can be replaced by a sublance (<b>2</b>) of the present invention without altering anything in the process, neither the rack storing spare sublances (<b>2</b>), nor the programming of the robot handling the sublances. This is made possible, because in the initial configuration, the protective device (<b>3</b>) does not alter substantially the geometry of the sublance. This solution is also quite economical to implement.</p>
