<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to various compositions and methods for regulating EGFR amplification in cancer in order to sensitize tumor cells to EGFR-targeted anti-cancer agents.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several publications and patent documents are cited throughout the specification in order to describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. Each of these citations is incorporated herein by reference as though set forth in full.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer cells (1). These abnormalities can include entire chromosome events or they can be localized to site-specific chromosomal regions (2). For example, the chromosome 112-25 (112-25) region is regularly amplified in tumors (3-9). This amplification event is often associated with drug resistance as a number of genes (e.g., MCL1, CKS1B which confer drug resistance) reside within this chromosomal region (3-9). Amplification of these regions can occur as frequently as the well documented oncogene amplifications MYC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in certain tumor types (e.g., 1921.3 at 21% versus MYC at 26% in liver cancer; (10)). However, it is important to note that amplifications are not always permanently integrated (2). A recent study estimated that approximately 50% of tumors contain extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplifications for the EGFR and MYC genes (11).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The extrachromosomal nature of these copy gains provides the cell an opportunity to either select for or against these amplifications, which will impact cell growth and drug response. For example, extrachromosomal amplification of EGFR results in increased sensitivity to targeted therapies. However, following prolonged treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, the ecDNA copies of EGFR are reduced, leading to therapy resistance (12). In the case of methotrexate therapy, the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene is amplified and provides resistance (13-16). DHFR amplifications can occur as integrated and/or extrachromosomal events (13-16).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is clear that extrachromosomal amplifications promote tumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptation, both of which are major contributors to drug resistance (2,11). Elucidating the cellular physiology and molecular mechanisms that promote oncogene-associated extrachromosomal events should have a profound impact on our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The molecular mechanisms underlying extrachromosomal amplification events are still poorly understood; however, recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for epigenetic states and chromatin modifying enzymes in controlling site-specific re-replication, and in turn, DNA copy number amplification (10,17-19). For example, overexpression or stabilization of the H3K9/36 tri-demethylase KDM4A, and the direct modulation of chromatin states (H3K9 and K36 methylation) promotes transient site-specific DNA copy gains (TSSGs) within the Chr1q12-21 region (17-20). These DNA copy gains are transiently generated during S phase and are lost in late S or early G2 phase of the cell cycle (18). Indeed, KDM4A interacts with components of the replication machinery, facilitating re-replication at the TSSG sites (18).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">EGFR DNA amplification tends to result in poor prognosis for patients with EGFR-amplified cancer (22). EGFR-targeted therapies have been developed in recent years (23) and EGFR amplifications have been shown to associate with varying degrees of patient response across various amplified tumors (24-29). EGFR DNA amplification is prevalent across a number of different cancer types, with up to 54% of patients exhibiting amplification in some tumor types (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) (10). An important clinical challenge with EGFR amplification is the plasticity of the amplification (12). Therefore, there is a major clinical need to resolve the mechanisms driving EGFR amplification in order to generate effective therapeutic strategies to treat these aggressive cancers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the present invention, a method for treating a subject having an EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) resistant tumor is provided. In one aspect, the method entails determining EGFR copy number in cells obtained from said tumor, contacting the cells with an agent that modulates amplification of EGFR to a level which sensitizes said cells to EGFR inhibitors; and administering to the subject an EGFRi, thereby reducing tumor cell proliferation or inducing tumor cell killing which exceeds that observed in tumor cells not treated with the EGFR amplification modulation agent. In certain embodiments, copy number is determined using DNA FISH. In a preferred embodiment, the EGFR copy number is determined to be high and said tumor cells are contacted with at least one inhibitor selected from EZH2 inhibitor, KDM5 inhibitor and KDM5A inhibitor which further increases EGFR amplification and sensitivity of said cells to EGFRi. In certain embodiments, the inhibitor inhibits EZH2. In other embodiments, the inhibitor is tazemetostat. The cells to be treated can be diploid for EGFR copies. The cells can have an EGFR copy number of between 3-7. In other aspects, the tumor cells have a copy number of EGFR of 8 or higher. In other embodiments, the cells exhibit a loss of heterozygosity in the EGFR region and the inhibitor is an EZH2 inhibitor. The tumor cells can also be contacted with at least one histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT), thereby increasing EGFR copy number and rendering the tumor more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors. The KMT can be selected from KMT2A, SETD1A and SETD1B. In other embodiments, the method includes administration of at least one EGFR inhibitor selected from gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, osimertinib, panitumumab, neratinib, vandetanib, necitumumab, and dacomitinib. In preferred embodiments, the at least one EGFR inhibitor is selected from gefinitnib or lapatnib.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect, the modulation of EGFR amplification reduces tumor heterogeneity. An exemplary method for reducing tumor heterogeneity in a subject in need thereof, in order to sensitize the tumor to EGFRi therapy, comprises reducing EGFR amplification levels via administration at least one KDM4 inhibitor and treating said tumor with an EGFR inhibitor. In certain cases, the tumor cells are hypoxic. The method can further comprise determining EGFR amplification levels prior to KDM4 inhibitor administration step. In other aspects of the methods, methylase and demethylase expression levels in the tumor are determined at protein and RNA levels. The inhibitors of the invention are administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier via route selected from the group consisting of systemic, oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intracerebral, intratumoral and topical administration. Preferred routes of administration include systemic and oral administration.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Acquired chromosomal DNA copy gains are a feature of many tumors; however, the mechanisms that underpin oncogene amplification are poorly understood. Recent studies have begun to uncover the importance of epigenetic states and histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) in regulating transient site-specific DNA copy number gains (TSSGs). We have revealed a critical interplay between a myriad of lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in modulating H3K4/9/27 methylation balance in order to control extrachromosomal amplification of the EGFR oncogene. Further, we establish that cellular signals (hypoxia and epidermal growth factor) are able to directly promote EGFR amplification through modulation of the enzymes controlling EGFR copy gains. Moreover, we demonstrate that chemical inhibitors targeting specific KMTs and KDMs are able to promote or block extrachromosomal EGFR amplification, which identifies useful therapeutic strategies for controlling EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer, and in turn, drug response.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">We demonstrate that chromatin modifying enzymes and their associated epigenetic states control amplification of the EGFR locus. Specifically, we demonstrate that directly interfering with H3K9 and H3K27 methylation promotes EGFR amplification. Furthermore, we establish a critical interplay between H3K4/9/27 lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in either promoting or blocking EGFR amplification. For example, KDM4A overexpression promotes EGFR copy gains in conjunction with three H3K4 methyltransferases: KMT2A/MLL1, SETD1A and SETD1B. In addition, we demonstrate that suppression of specific H3K9 KMTs and the H3K27 KMT EZH2 generates EGFR amplification. Consistent with these genetic experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that chemical inhibitors targeting KMT-KDMs are able to rheostat EGFR copy number, and in turn, growth factor and EGFR inhibitor responses. Lastly, we demonstrate that extrinsic cellular cues, such as hypoxia and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), promote EGFR amplification by modulating the KMT-KDM network that controls EGFR copy number. Taken together, this data uncovers both chromatin modifiers and extracellular signals that control EGFR amplification and demonstrate that epigenetic therapies could hold a key to modulating EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer, which has significant clinical implications.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For purposes of the present invention, &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; entity refers to one or more of that entity; for example, &#x201c;a cDNA&#x201d; refers to one or more cDNA or at least one cDNA. As such, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; can be used interchangeably herein. It is also noted that the terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; can be used interchangeably. Furthermore, a compound &#x201c;selected from the group consisting of&#x201d; refers to one or more of the compounds in the list that follows, including mixtures (i.e. combinations) of two or more of the compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; when referring to a particular nucleotide or amino acid means a sequence having the properties of a given SEQ ID NO. For example, when used in reference to an amino acid sequence, the phrase includes the sequence per se and molecular modifications that would not affect the functional and novel characteristics of the sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; of a polypeptide, polynucleotide or fragments thereof means a sequence modified by varying the sequence of the construct, e.g. by manipulation of the nucleic acid encoding the protein or by altering the protein itself. &#x201c;Derivatives&#x201d; of a gene or nucleotide sequence refers to any isolated nucleic acid molecule that contains significant sequence similarity to the gene or nucleotide sequence or a part thereof. In addition, &#x201c;derivatives&#x201d; include such isolated nucleic acids containing modified nucleotides or mimetics of naturally-occurring nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;functional&#x201d; as used herein implies that the nucleic or amino acid sequence is functional for the recited assay or purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For purposes of the invention, &#x201c;Nucleic acid&#x201d;, &#x201c;nucleotide sequence&#x201d; or a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; as used herein refers to any DNA or RNA molecule, either single or double stranded and, if single stranded, the molecule of its complementary sequence in either linear or circular form. In discussing nucleic acid molecules, a sequence or structure of a particular nucleic acid molecule may be described herein according to the normal convention of providing the sequence in the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; direction. With reference to nucleic acids of the invention, the term &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid&#x201d; is sometimes used. This term, when applied to DNA, refers to a DNA molecule that is separated from sequences with which it is immediately contiguous in the naturally occurring genome of the organism in which it originated. For example, an &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid&#x201d; may comprise a DNA molecule inserted into a vector, such as a plasmid or virus vector, or integrated into the genomic DNA of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell or host organism. Alternatively, this term may refer to a DNA that has been sufficiently separated from (e.g., substantially free of) other cellular components with which it would naturally be associated. &#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; is not meant to exclude artificial or synthetic mixtures with other compounds or materials, or the presence of impurities that do not interfere with the fundamental activity, and that may be present, for example, due to incomplete purification. When applied to RNA, the term &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid&#x201d; refers primarily to an RNA molecule encoded by an isolated DNA molecule as defined above. Alternatively, the term may refer to an RNA molecule that has been sufficiently separated from other nucleic acids with which it would be associated in its natural state (i.e., in cells or tissues). An isolated nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) may further represent a molecule produced directly by biological or synthetic means and separated from other components present during its production.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the present invention, an isolated or biologically pure molecule or cell is a compound that has been removed from its natural milieu. As such, &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; and &#x201c;biologically pure&#x201d; do not necessarily reflect the extent to which the compound has been purified. An isolated compound of the present invention can be obtained from its natural source, can be produced using laboratory synthetic techniques or can be produced by any such chemical synthetic route.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The terms &#x201c;extrachromosomal DNA&#x201d; or &#x201c;ecDNA&#x201d; refer to any DNA that is found off the chromosomes, either inside or outside the nucleus. Multiple forms of ecDNA exist and can play an important role in diseases such as cancer. ecDNA has been identified in the nuclei of various cancer cells and has been shown to carry many copies of driver oncogenes. ecDNA is considered to be a primary mechanism of gene amplification, resulting in many copies of driver oncogenes and very aggressive cancers.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The terms &#x201c;miRNA&#x201d; and &#x201c;microRNA&#x201d; refer to about 10-35 nt, preferably about 15-30 nt, and more preferably about 19-26 nt, non-coding RNAs derived from endogenous genes encoded in the genomes of plants and animals. They are processed from longer hairpin-like precursors termed pre-miRNAs that are often hundreds of nucleotides in length. MicroRNAs assemble in complexes termed miRNPs and recognize their targets by antisense complementarity. These highly conserved, endogenously expressed RNAs are believed to regulate the expression of genes by binding to the 3&#x2032;-untranslated regions (3&#x2032;-UTR) of specific mRNAs as well as other regions on targeted mRNAs. Without being bound by theory, a possible mechanism of action assumes that if the microRNAs match 100% their target, i.e. the complementarity is complete, the target mRNA is cleaved, and the miRNA acts like a siRNA. However, if the match is incomplete, i.e. the complementarity is partial, then the translation of the target mRNA is blocked. The manner by which a miRNA base-pairs with its mRNA target correlates with its function: if the complementarity between a mRNA and its target is extensive, the RNA target is cleaved; if the complementarity is partial, the stability of the target mRNA in not affected but its translation is repressed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;RNA interference&#x201d; or &#x201c;RNAi&#x201d; refers generally to a process or system in which a RNA molecule changes the expression of a nucleic acid sequence with which RNA molecule shares substantial or total homology. The term &#x201c;RNAi agent&#x201d; refers to an RNA sequence that elicits RNAi.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An &#x201c;siRNA&#x201d; refers to a molecule involved in the RNA interference process for a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing or gene knockdown by providing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that has homology with the sequence of the targeted gene. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be synthesized in vitro or generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNA and are the mediators of sequence-specific mRNA degradation. Preferably, the siRNA of the invention are chemically synthesized using appropriately protected ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer. The siRNA can be synthesized as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions. Commercial suppliers of synthetic RNA molecules or synthesis reagents include Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif., USA), Proligo (Hamburg, Germany), Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, Colo., USA), Pierce Chemical (part of Perbio Science, Rockford, Ill., USA), Glen Research (Sterling, Va., USA), ChemGenes (Ashland, Mass., USA) and Cruachem (Glasgow, UK).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A &#x201c;small nucleic acid inhibitor&#x201d; refers to any sequence based nucleic acid molecule which, when introduced into a cell expressing the target nucleic acid, is capable of modulating expression of that target. siRNA, antisense, miRNA, shRNA and the like may be utilized in the methods of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;delivery&#x201d; as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign molecule (i.e., miRNA containing nanoparticle) into cells. The term &#x201c;administration&#x201d; as used herein means the introduction of a foreign molecule into a cell. The term is intended to be synonymous with the term &#x201c;delivery&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a compound or pharmaceutical composition refers to an amount sufficient to modulate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal, especially a human, including without limitation decreasing tumor growth or size or preventing formation of tumor growth in an animal lacking any tumor formation prior to administration, i.e., prophylactic administration.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, as used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; refers, for example to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, auxiliary agent or vehicle with which an active agent of the present invention is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in &#x201c;Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences&#x201d; by E. W. Martin.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by any suitable route, for example, by injection, by oral, pulmonary, nasal or other forms of administration. In general, pharmaceutical compositions contemplated to be within the scope of the invention, comprise, inter alia, pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions can include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc., or into liposomes. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of components of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18042) pages 1435 1712 which are herein incorporated by reference. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be prepared, for example, in liquid form, or can be in dried powder, such as lyophilized form. Particular methods of administering such compositions are described infra.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In yet another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered in a controlled release system, such as using an intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In a particular embodiment, a pump may be used [see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)]. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used [see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Press: Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley: New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)]. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the target tissues of the animal, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose [see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115 138 (1984)]. In particular, a controlled release device can be introduced into an animal in proximity of the site of inappropriate immune activation or a tumor. Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer [Science 249:1527 1533 (1990)].</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein the term &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; refers to a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;modulate&#x201d;, &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; or &#x201c;modulation&#x201d; refer to changing the rate at which a particular process occurs, inhibiting or promoting a particular process, reversing a particular process, and/or preventing the initiation of a particular process. Accordingly, if the particular process is tumor growth or metastasis, the term &#x201c;modulation&#x201d; includes, without limitation, decreasing the rate at which tumor growth and/or metastasis occurs; inhibiting tumor growth and/or metastasis; reversing tumor growth and/or metastasis (including tumor shrinkage and/or eradication) and/or preventing tumor growth and/or metastasis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;tumor&#x201d;, &#x201c;tumor growth&#x201d; or &#x201c;tumor tissue&#x201d; can be used interchangeably, and refer to an abnormal growth of tissue resulting from uncontrolled progressive multiplication of cells and serving no physiological function. A solid tumor can be malignant, e.g. tending to metastasize and being life threatening, or benign. Examples of solid tumors that can be treated or prevented according to a method of the present invention include sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, liver metastases, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma such as anaplastic thyroid cancer, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma such as small cell lung carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and retinoblastoma.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;chromosomal instability&#x201d; refers to a higher than normal rate of mis-segregation of chromosomes or parts of chromosomes during mitosis due to defective cell cycle quality control mechanisms, resulting in copy number alterations (CNAs) or aneuploidy.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The phrase &#x201c;gene amplification&#x201d; or &#x201c;copy number amplification&#x201d; refers to an increase in the number of copies of a gene sequence. There may also be an increase in the RNA and protein made from that gene. Gene amplification is common in cancer cells, and some amplified genes may cause cancer cells to grow or become resistant to anticancer drugs. Gene amplification of oncogens on ecDNA is a frequent event in cancer. Unequal segregation of ecDNA from a parental tumor cell to offspring cells can rapidly increase tumor heterogeneity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The phrase &#x201c;tumor heterogeneity&#x201d; refers to differences between cancer cells in a tumor. For example, a tumor may have multiple populations characterized by different genetic variants. Tumor heterogeneity can provide the tumor with an additional array of responses to microenvironment-induced and therapy-induced stress factors. These differences may explain why some tumor cells remain present in a patient after cancer treatment has finished. Reduced tumor heterogeneity leads to improved success with cancer treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term &#x201c;drug response&#x201d; as used herein, means any biological response in an organism that is the result of exposure to the drug. Drug responses can be favorable, such as when a patient's disease is eradicated by treatment with the drug, or unfavorable, such as when a patient enters a coma upon treatment with a drug.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The phrase &#x201c;drug resistant tumor&#x201d; refers to any tumor that retains tumor cells after cancer treatment has finished. A drug resistant tumor may be resistant to a specific treatment, e.g. treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, or may be resistant to multiple forms of treatment. A drug resistant tumor may initially have a favorable response to the drug, however some cells may remain unaffected.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Epigenetic state or Epigenetic phenomena, as used herein, means changes produced in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. For example, methylation of cytosines (Cs) or histone modifications can affect expression of a gene. These molecular modifications of the DNA are often called &#x201c;epigenetic marks.&#x201d; For example, increased or decreased methylation of Cs in a genome are part of normal biology but can also be associated with disease. As used herein, &#x201c;epigenetic state&#x201d; refers to a gene or region in a genome that reflects particular epigenetic phenomena. For example, in a particular disease cohort, a gene can be found that causes disease through multiple mechanisms, including, but not limited to, impairment of protein function by a SNV, deletion of the gene via a CNV, little or no expression of the gene due to a change in the epigenetic state of the gene itself and/or regulatory region(s) in the genome controlling expression of the gene.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The phrase &#x201c;histone lysine methyltransferase&#x201d; or &#x201c;KMT&#x201d; refers to a histone-modifying enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of one, two, or three methyl groups to lysine residues of histone proteins. An inhibitor of KTM is, for example, chaetocin, DANep, BIX-01294, EGCG, sinefungin, adenoine dialdehyde, and novobiocin.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The phrase &#x201c;histone lysine demethylase&#x201d; or &#x201c;KDM&#x201d; refers to a histone-modifying enzyme that catalyzes the removal of methyl groups from the lysine residues of histone proteins. Methylated histones can either repress or activate transcription depending on the site of methylation. An inhibitor of KDM is, for example, tranylcyprome, phenelzine, a polyamine analogue, N-oxalyglycine (NOG), disulfuram, ebselen, and an N-oxalyl D-tyrosine derivative.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">An &#x201c;inhibitor&#x201d; (interchangeably termed &#x201c;antagonist&#x201d;) of a polypeptide of interest is an agent that interferes with activation or function of the polypeptide of interest, e.g., partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity mediated by a polypeptide of interest. For example, an antagonist of polypeptide X may refers to any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity mediated by polypeptide X. Examples of inhibitors include antibodies; ligand antibodies; small molecule antagonists; antisense and inhibitory RNA (e.g., siRNA) molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The phrase &#x201c;EGFR inhibitor&#x201d; refers to any compound natural occurring or synthesized, having the ability of inhibiting EGFR amplification. An EGFR inhibitor is for example, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, Osimertinib, panitumumab, neratinib, vandetanib, necitumumab, and dacomitinib.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The phrase &#x201c;KDM4 inhibitor&#x201d; refers to any compound natural occurring or synthesized, having the ability of inhibiting at least one member of the KDM4 family.

Other KDM4 inhibitors are known by those skilled in the art. See, e.g., (67-71).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The phrase &#x201c;EZH2 inhibitor&#x201d; refers to any compound natural occurring or synthesized, having the ability of inhibiting at least one member of the EZH2 family or interfere with EZH2 function. Examples of EZH2 inhibitors include tazmetostat, CPI-0209, GSK2816126 (GSK126), tazemelostat, DS-3201, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), EPZ00S687, Ei1, GSK343, GSK926, EPZ011989, CPI-1205, CPI-169, ZLD1039, PF-06821497, UNC1999, OR-S1/OR-S2, DS-3201b, DS-3201, SAH-EZH2, Astemizole, Wedelolactone, apomorphine hydrochloride, oxyphenbutazone, nifedipine, ergonovine maleate, Osimertinib (AZD9291), MAK683(EED226), A769662, GNA022, ANCR, FBW7, ZRANB1, OR-S1, OR-S2, and OR-S0.

For hypoxic treatment, cells were maintained in a HERA Cell 150 incubator (Thermo Scientific) flushed with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 1% O<sub>2 </sub>and balanced with N<sub>2 </sub>for the duration of the experiment. Cells were cultured in hypoxia for between 24 and 48 hours, prior to harvesting and downstream experimental processing. Hypoxic culture conditions were validated by immunoblot detection of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) expression, a well-established hypoxic biomarker signature (17).</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="2">Transfection Procedure</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Cells were plated in cell culture dishes and allowed to adhere for 16-20 hours. Cell culture medium was removed and cells rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to siRNA transfections (5 nM-10 nM/transfection) being performed using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) in OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies). Transfections were changed to complete cell culture media after 4 hr of transfection, and cells were collected 72 hr post transfection. For co-transfection experiments both siRNA sequences were transfected at the same time. For experiments involving hypoxia or drug treatment, cells were exposed to these conditions at least 48 hours post-siRNA transfection.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Transient overexpression transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent and P3000 reagent (Life Technologies) in OPTI-MEM medium for 4 hrs, followed by changing to complete media. Silencer select negative controls and siRNAs were purchased from Life Technologies. Their sequences and SEQ ID Nos: are shown in Table 1. At least two different siRNAs against every gene were used for each experiment.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0070">Plasmids for H3.3 wild type (WT), K4M, K9M, K27M and K36M mutants were provided by Peter Lewis (University of Wisconsin). Virus was generated by co-transfection of specific plasmids along with the packaging plasmids (AmphoPAK and VSVG) in 293T cells, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies). DNA transfection was performed in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) overnight. The virus containing supernatant was collected after 24 hrs. RPE cells were infected in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene for 12 hrs with the viral supernatant (18). Cells were washed two times with DMEM, prior to being cultured in complete medium for 48 hours, before harvesting. For hypoxia, drug or growth factor treatment and overexpression experiments involving H3.3 K4M, RPE cells were infected as described above and cultured for 24 hours post infection before additional treatment (hypoxia, drug or growth factor treatment, or KDM4A transient-overexpression). Cells were harvested 24 hours later. For all experiments involving Histone H3.3 variants, RPE, HT-29 and HCC827 cells were harvested 48 hours after viral infection for western blot, cell cycle profiles and DNA FISH analysis.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0071">Cells were washed and collected by trypsinization, followed by washing in PBS two times. Cell pellet was resuspended in Qiazol reagent (QIAGEN) and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. before further processing. Total RNA was extracted using miRNAeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with an on-column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Single strand cDNA was prepared using Super Script IV first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using random hexamers. Expression levels were analyzed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a LightCycler 480 PCR machine (Roche). Samples were normalized to &#x3b2;-actin. Primer sequences are provided in Table 2.</p>

Cells were lysed on ice for 15 min and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until further processing. Lysates were sonicated for 15 min (30 sec ON and 30 sec OFF cycle) at 70% amplitude in QSonica Q700 sonicator (Qsonica) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Cell lysate was transferred to a fresh tube and protein estimations were performed with Pierce BCA reagent (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane (BioTrace NT, Pall Life Sciences) for at least 3 hr at a constant current. The membranes were blocked for at least 1 hr in 5% BSA-PBST (1&#xd7;PBS with 0.5% Tween-20) or 5% milk-PBST and probed over night with specific antibodies as follows at the following dilutions: anti-GFP (Neuro mAb) (1:100); anti-&#x3b2;-Actin (1:10,000); anti-KDM4A (Neuro mAb) (1:100); anti-Flag (Sigma Aldrich) (1:500); anti-KDMSA (abcam) (1:500); anti-HALO (Promega) (1:1000); anti-Carbonic Anhydrase IX (Abcam) (1:1000).</p>

<heading id="h-0032" level="1">K9 and K27 Methylation Interference Promotes EGFR Amplification</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0101">Previous analysis demonstrated that up to 54% of primary tumors across the pancancer TCGA dataset harbour EGFR amplifications of which some were shown to harbour extrachromosomal amplification (10,11). To further explore EGFR amplification heterogeneity across and within tumors, we assessed the range of EGFR DNA copy gains and the associated EGFR RNA expression levels in each of the tumors in the pancancer TCGA dataset (7069 samples; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The analyses revealed significant plasticity in EGFR DNA copy number across tumor types, ranging from 2.4-8 copies (red) to more than 8 copies (blue) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). We also observed tumors with a loss of EGFR (black; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). As the DNA copy number increased there was an increase in EGFR RNA levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Therefore, promoting more EGFR DNA copies tends to associate with increased EGFR transcripts in tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0102">Since there is a range of EGFR DNA copy gains across tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and others have observed amplification plasticity (12), we assessed whether perturbation of epigenetic states associated with transient site-specific DNA amplifications could promote EGFR DNA copy gains (10,18). Prior studies demonstrated that the introduction of histone 3.3 lysine to methionine (H3.3 K-M) mutants into cells could interfere with the associated methylation at that specific lysine (30). In fact, we demonstrated that transducing cells with different H3.3 KM mutants could interfere with associated methylation, and in turn, promote amplification at specific regions in the genome (18,30). For example, 1q12h was copy gained with the introduction of H3.3K9M and H3.3K36M (18), while 1p32.3 was amplified with only H3.3K36M (10). These data illustrate the localized impact that modifying specific lysine methylation states have on the predilection of regions to undergo amplification versus whole genome instability and amplification (10,18). For these reasons, we tested whether introduction of H3K-M mutants into the immortalized retinal pigmental epithelial (RPE) cells that have a nearly diploid genome (18,31) and no documented mutations in the EGFR gene could allow us to identify residues important in repressing EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Since cell cycle arrest (e.g., G1/S; (18)) has been shown to block copy gains driven by epigenetic perturbation, we evaluated cell cycle profiles for each mutant tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Our analyses did not reveal major changes in cell cycle profiles between cells expressing the different H3.3 K-M mutants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>); therefore, the cells were subsequently processed for DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (DNA FISH) to determine the copy number status of EGFR.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0103">Individually H3.3 K9M and H3.3 K27M resulted in significant increases in EGFR DNA copy number, without changing the copy number of chromosome 7 and 8 centromeres (7C and 8C, respectively; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C</figref>), the 7p telomere (7p tel, 7p22.2; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) or at a region adjacent to EGFR (IKZF1, 7p12.2; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). These data suggest that EGFR is undergoing site-specific copy gain as opposed to a whole chromosome 7 or chromosome 7p arm copy gain events, which is consistent with prior studies illustrating that exposure to K9M could promote site-specific amplifications on chromosome 1 (10,18). To date, no other region undergoing site-specific copy gain has been shown to be controlled by H3K27M (10,18). We also observed that &#x2dc;1-2% of cells in the K9M and K27M mutants had higher EGFR amplification levels than wild type H3.3 (&#x3e;5 copies; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F, <b>1</b>G</figref>). Consistent with this increase in EGFR copy number, these cells also had a modest increase in EGFR transcript levels when compared to cells expressing a wild type H3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>). Of interest, H3.3K4M and H3.3K36M did not promote EGFR copy gains. H3.3K36M has been shown to promote copy gains of other regions (e.g., 1q12h, 1921.2, 1p32.3) (10,18), which further highlights the specificity of epigenetic states in modulating amplification sensitivity in the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0104">Consistent with these observations, our ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with publicly available Hi-C data in RPE cells (32) suggest that the genomic vicinity of the EGFR locus has a specific chromosome structure and pattern of chromatin modifications (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>). The EGFR gene body corresponds to a subdomain within a larger 500 kilobase (Kbp) 3D interaction domain, that also includes another gene, SEC61G. Both gene bodies are enriched in H3K36me3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>). This chromatin interaction domain is flanked by two wide &#x2dc;100 Kbp regions enriched in H3K27me3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>, marked with blue shadow). The H3K27me3 region immediately adjacent to the 3&#x2032; end of the EGFR gene forms a chromatin interaction domain reminiscent of the small Polycomb-generated domains described by Kundu et al (33). This subdomain on one boundary of the EGFR-containing domain interacts with the H3K27me3 region on the opposite boundary of the EGFR-containing domain, resulting in the streak of interactions above this domain in the Hi-C map (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>). This looping interaction between distant H3K27me3 regions is similar to the Polycomb-mediated looping interactions previously described (33). Thus, EGFR resides within a 3D interaction domain whose boundaries are marked by two wide regions of H3K27me3 enrichment that form a looping interaction with each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0105">At a larger scale, the EGFR-containing domain, together with the adjacent H3K27me3-enriched boundary regions and two other interaction domains to the 3&#x2032; of EGFR are part of &#x2dc;1 megabase (Mb) region that is flanked on both sides by wide areas of H3K9me3 enrichment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref>). In order to assess the significance of these associations, we evaluated a panel of cells analysed by ENCODE (34,35). In all cases, they contain similar configurations of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 at the noted locations in the RPE cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I-<b>1</b>L</figref>). Cells that did not express EGFR had broader H3K27me3 in between the domains we documented in RPE cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>K, <b>1</b>L</figref>). Furthermore, this pattern was conserved at the modification and organizational level when analyzing a mouse lymphoblast cell line C12-LX (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>L</figref>) (34,35). Lastly, we analysed publicly available H3K27me3 data in cells expressing H3.3K27M (36) and observed a loss of the H3K27me3 domains that flank EGFR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>), which was consistent with a direct effect on the locus, and in turn, amplification observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C</figref>. Taken together, these epigenomic profiles and our genetic experiments using mutated histones are consistent with the possibility that this topological structure and H3K9/27 methylation are suppressing the propensity of the EGFR locus to undergo amplification and increased expression.</p>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">KDM4A Overexpression Promotes EGFR Copy Number Gains</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0106">The KDM4 family of histone lysine demethylases catalyze H3K9 and K36 demethylation (37,38). In addition, this enzyme family directly regulates DNA amplifications associated with H3K9 and K36 demethylation (10,18). Therefore, we tested whether overexpression of the KDM4 family of enzymes could phenocopy the increase in EGFR copy number observed upon H3K9 methylation interference. The GFP-tagged KDM4 family members were transiently overexpressed for 24 hours followed by DNA FISH analysis for EGFR DNA copy number (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>). Of the overexpressed KDM4 family members, only transient KDM4A overexpression promoted increased EGFR DNA copy number, which highlights the specificity of KDM4A in regulating the EGFR locus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Furthermore, catalytically inactive KDM4A (H188A; (38)) and a mutant lacking the Tudor domains that recognize H3K4 methylation (Tudor Del; (39)) were unable to promote EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G-<b>3</b>I</figref>). These data were also confirmed with RPE cells that stably overexpressed KDM4A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C, <b>4</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>J, <b>3</b>K</figref>). Chromosome 7 or 8 centromere loci, 7p Tel as well as other previously tested loci were not impacted by KDM4A overexpression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>I</figref>; (<b>10</b>,<b>18</b>)).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0107">Consistent with these findings, analysis of available KDM4A ChIP-seq data (40) revealed that KDM4A was enriched across the EGFR locus between the H3K9me3 blocks (1.6 Mb; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, upper panel: KDM4A in blue and H3K9me3 in black). These observations were consistent with the previous analyses that noted KDM4A occupied the EGFR promoter region (40), which occurs within this larger binding domain that we have identified. In addition to promoting copy gains, KDM4A overexpression also increased EGFR transcripts as determined by both RNA-sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E, <b>4</b>F</figref>). These findings are entirely consistent with a recent report that demonstrated a role for KDM4A in regulating EGFR gene expression (40). Taken together, these data illustrate that KDM4A directly regulates this locus and plays a fundamental role in generating EGFR DNA copy gains and in regulating EGFR expression.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0108">Since KDM4A overexpression promoted EGFR copy gains and increased RNA expression, we assessed the impact that KDM4A overexpression had on EGFR inhibitor sensitivity. We observed increased sensitivity to both Lapatinib and Gefitinib in KDM4A overexpressing cells when compared to control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G, <b>4</b>H</figref>). Based on these data, we further reasoned that EGF supplementation would promote cell proliferation and migration in KDM4A overexpressing cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, KDM4A overexpressing cells had a modest but significant increase in cell migration as compared to control cells in scratch assays and increased cell proliferation in response to EGF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>I, <b>4</b>J</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>L</figref>). Furthermore, the increased cell proliferation upon EGF-treatment in KDM4A overexpressing cells was completely suppressed by siRNA-mediated depletion of EGFR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>K</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>M</figref>), which emphasized the importance of increased EGFR gene expression in order to observe the increased cell proliferation.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0109">Since EGFR amplifications are observed in lung tumors (10,22) and cancer cell lines (i.e., HCC827; (41,42)), we tested whether KDM4A could be contributing to the observed EGFR amplifications in lung cancer cells. We used both KDM4A siRNA depletion and chemical inhibition (KDM4i (QC6352); (43)) of the KDM4 family to assess the impact of KDM4A on EGFR amplification. Specifically, we used DNA FISH to test whether the classically used EGFR amplified HCC827 lung cancer cells would have reduced amplifications upon KDM4A depletion or inhibition. HCC827 cells, in addition to exhibiting extensive EGFR amplification, have an acquired activating mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (Exon 19 deletion) (41). As previously noted, HCC827 cells had very high EGFR DNA amplification levels that form large EGFR gene cluster clouds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). The amplifications are so abundant that they appear as clouds in the interphase nuclei (42). However, KDM4A depletion significantly reduced the size of EGFR amplified clouds in the HCC827 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B</figref>). Furthermore, KDM4 family inhibition significantly reduced the extent of EGFR amplification in these cells as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C, <b>5</b>D</figref>). Based on these observations and the fact that EGFR DNA amplification has been shown to correlate with better EGFR inhibitor responses in patients (24-29), we hypothesized that KDM4 inhibitor treatment would reduce the sensitivity of HCC827 cells to the EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib. As anticipated, a reduction in EGFR DNA amplification directly correlated with a reduced response to Gefitinib (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, right panel). Taken together, these data highlight a functional and significant role for KDM4A in modulating EGFR amplifications, expression and response to both EGFR inhibitors and growth factors in both diploid, non-transformed cells and EGFR amplified cancer cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0034" level="1">H3K9 KMTs Regulate EGFR Copy Number</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0110">Since K9 methylation interference and catalytically active KDM4A overexpression promoted EGFR amplification, we tested whether each of the H3K9 lysine methyltransferases (K9 KMT) were equally capable of inhibiting EGFR copy gains or whether there was enzyme specificity. Specifically, RPE cells were siRNA depleted with at least two independent siRNAs for each K9 KMT. The knockdowns were confirmed and cell cycle profiles were generated for each siRNA, which ensures no overt arrests occurred, and in turn, interfere with EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>F</figref>). Samples were then analyzed by EGFR DNA FISH. With the exception of G9a/KMT1C, depletion of all other K9 KMTs resulted in a significant increase in EGFR DNA copy number (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). These data coupled with the methylation interference and demethylase activity requirement, strongly suggest that maintaining the degree of H3K9mel/2/3 methylation at this locus is critical for preventing amplification. Consistent with this notion, H3K9mel/2/3 ChIP-seq illustrated that the higher ordered organized domains that contained the EGFR locus were enriched for H3K9mel/2 between the H3K9me3 flanking blocks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Taken together, these data imply the need to balance H3K9 methylation in order to prevent or promote EGFR copy gains.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0111">In addition to H3K9 methylation interference causing EGFR amplification, we also observed that H3K27 methylation interference increased EGFR copy number (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C</figref>). Therefore, we sought to further explore the importance of K27 methylation in modulating EGFR amplification. First, we compared a publicly available EZH2 ChIP-seq dataset (44) to our H3K27me3 profiles. We observed an overlap between EZH2 occupancy and the H3K27me3 domains that flank the EGFR locus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). These binding profiles and the fact H3K27 methylation interference promoted EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C</figref>) and reduced H3K27me3 flanking the EGFR locus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>M</figref>) prompted us to then test whether EZH2 siRNA-mediated depletion or chemical inhibition would phenocopy H3K27 methylation interference-induced EGFR copy gains.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0112">Using two independent siRNAs against EZH2 in RPE cells, we observed a significant increase in EGFR copy number while not changing copy number of other chr7 regions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G-<b>7</b>K</figref>). We further demonstrated that a specific EZH2 pharmacological inhibitor (EZH2i&#x2014;C24; (45)) was able to promote EGFR amplification in a dose-dependent manner while not altering copy number of other loci in RPE cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D, <b>8</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>L,<b>11</b>M</figref>). EGFR copy number was also increased in colorectal cancer cell lines that have either low (HCT-15) or high (HT-29) EGFR copy number when treated with the EZH2i (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>N-<b>7</b>Q</figref>). Furthermore, removing EZH2i from RPE cells (referred to as washout) allowed EGFR copy gains to return to baseline, which highlights their transient nature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>M</figref>). At the higher doses of EZH2 inhibition, EZH2i also resulted in a higher number of copies within some of the copy gained nuclei and increased EGFR transcript (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>), which phenocopies H3K27M transduced cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F-<b>1</b>H</figref>). Furthermore, ChIP-seq analyses of PC9 cells (lung adenocarcinoma) treated with an EZH2 inhibitor (44) also showed a reduction in the H3K27me3 domains flanking EGFR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref>). In order to further explore the importance of H3K27me3 in preventing the EGFR locus from amplifying, we overexpressed each of the H3K27 demethylases&#x2014;KDM6A and KDM6B&#x2014;individually and then conducted EGFR FISH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>I and <b>7</b>R, <b>7</b>S</figref>). In contrast to the specificity observed with KDM4 family members, both KDM6 members promoted EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>I</figref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate a critical role for H3K27 methylation and the associated enzymes in preventing the EGFR locus from undergoing amplification and expression.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0113">Since EZH2 inhibition promoted EGFR amplification and increased expression levels, we tested whether cells treated with the EZH2i or EZH2 siRNA depletion would respond differently to EGF supplementation. Specifically, cells were pre-treated with EZH2 inhibitor for 24 hours or depleted with two independent EZH2 siRNAs in order to promote increases in EGFR copy number before being supplemented with DMSO or EGF. Both EZH2 inhibitor and EZH2 siRNA treated cells demonstrated a significantly increased proliferation in response to exogenous supplementation with EGF compared to DMSO-treated cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>J, <b>8</b>K</figref>). Moreover, EGFR/EZH2 siRNA co-depletion completely blocked the increased response to EGF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>K</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>T</figref>). These data are consistent with a prior report noting that combined inhibition of EZH2 and EGFR were able to increase the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells when compared to either drug alone (46). Our data suggest that this observation could be in part through EZH2i-induced EGFR DNA amplification. In support of this hypothesis, EZH2i treatment in two different colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-15 and HT-29) resulted in increases in EGFR DNA copy number in these cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>N-<b>7</b>Q</figref>), which paralleled their sensitivity (46). Taken together, these data illustrate a critical role for K27 methylation, EZH2 and KDM6 in modulating EGFR locus amplification, expression, and in turn, cellular response to either EGFRi or growth factors.</p>
<heading id="h-0036" level="1">H3K4 and H3K27 Methylation Controls EGFR Amplification</heading>
<p id="p-0119" num="0114">In a recent study, we demonstrated that H3K4 methylation enrichment at specific genomic loci was sufficient to recruit KDM4 family members to chromatin, and in turn, promote copy number gains on chromosome 1 (e.g., 1q12h and 1p32.3; (10)). Upon evaluating H3K4mel/2/3 across the EGFR locus, we observed an inverse relationship between H3K4 methylation states and H3K27me3, which appears to flank the regions containing H3K4 methylation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of EZH2 promoted the KDM4A driven EGFR copy gains through H3K4 methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, RPE cells transduced with H3.3 K4M did not generate EGFR copy gains upon EZH2 inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B</figref>), which highlights the importance of this amino acid in promoting EGFR copy gains downstream of EZH2 depletion or inhibition. Furthermore, KDM4A was required for EZH2 depletion to generate EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0115">Since H3K4 methylation is key to KDM4A binding and copy gain generation at other specific sites in the genome (10,18), we also tested whether H3K4M would block KDM4A promoted EGFR copy gains. Indeed, H3K4M blocked KDM4A driven EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C, <b>10</b>D</figref>). Consistent with these observations, HCC827 cells containing the EGFR amplification clouds that were reduced in size upon KDM4A depletion and inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) also had a significant reduction EGFR cloud size with H3K4M transduction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C, <b>9</b>D</figref>). A similar reduction was also observed with H3K4M transduction in the HT-29 cells that contain EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E, <b>10</b>F</figref>). Furthermore, the Tudor domains that recognize H3K4 methylation within KDM4A (39) were required to generate EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Taken together, these data collectively emphasize the importance of H3K4 methylation for generating the EGFR amplifications and highlight the need to balance K4/27 methylation states in order to modulate EGFR copy gains through KDM4A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0116">H3K4 KMTs were recently shown to be important in controlling the predilection of regions to amplify downstream of KDM4 members. For example, overexpression of each KMT2 family member promoted copy gains of specific chromosome 1 TSSG loci (10). Therefore, we overexpressed each H3K4 KMT (MLL1/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2B, MLL4/KMT2D, SETD1A and SETD1B; (47)) to determine whether all or select KMTs promote EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G-<b>10</b>I</figref>). Only KMT2A, SETD1A and SETD1B were able to significantly promote EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>). To date, the EGFR loci was the only target identified for SETD1A. Since EZH2 and the MLL family of KMTs oppose one another and their associated methylation states (48), we tested whether EGFR amplifications that occur downstream of EZH2 depletion are dependent on these H3K4 KMTs. When EZH2 and each KMT2 member (KMT2A, SETD1A, SETD1B) were co-depleted, the EGFR copy gains were blocked, which highlights the importance of H3K4 methylation upon EZH2 depletion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>J, <b>10</b>K</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0117">Since specific H3K4 KMTs controlled EGFR amplification, we tested whether the same was true for the H3K4 KDMs. The KDM5 enzymes are H3K4 tri-demethylases and have been shown to impact other TSSG sites (10). Depletion of the H3K4 tri-demethylases will increase H3K4 methylation, thereby promoting copy gains of EGFR if copy gains of this locus are indeed dependent on H3K4 methylation. Therefore, we depleted each KDM5 member with at least two independent siRNAs before conducting cell cycle profiles and EGFR FISH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>L, <b>10</b>M</figref>). Only KDM5A depletion generated EGFR copy gains, while other genomic loci were unaffected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>H</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>N-<b>10</b>P</figref>; (10)). Consistent with these genetic experiments, we observed enrichment for H3K4me3 upon ChIP-seq at an intergenic region within the EGFR structural domain that is 87 Kb upstream of the EGFR transcription start site (TSS) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>I</figref>, blue shaded region). Furthermore, we observed a loss of this H3K4me3 peak upon shMLL1 treatment in a published dataset (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>J</figref>; (49)) and enrichment upon shEZH2 treatment in a public dataset that was accompanied with reduced H3K27me3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>K</figref>; (50)). Moreover, RPE cells that overexpress KDM4A exhibited increases in H3K4me3 as well as a reduction in H3K9me3 at this same region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>L, <b>9</b>M</figref>, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that KMT2 enzymes, KDM5A and EZH2 modulate the balance of H3K4/27 methylation at the EGFR locus, and in turn, EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>N</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0118">Our studies suggest that promoting H3K4 methylation through KDM5A depletion or inhibition would promote EGFR amplification through KDM4A. First, we evaluated the impact of KDM5 inhibitor (KDM5i) treatment on EGFR amplification (KDM5i-C70; (51,52)). KDM5i treatment promoted EGFR copy gains, however, they returned to baseline upon KDM5i washout (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>O</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>Q</figref>), which emphasizes the reversibility of the amplifications as observed with EZH2i washout. We then used both genetic and chemical inhibition of KDM4 enzymes (KDM4i; (43)) to determine whether this would block EGFR amplifications generated upon either KDM5A siRNA depletion or KDM5i treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>&#x3b2;-<b>9</b>R and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>R-<b>10</b>U</figref>). In fact, the use of KDM5 and KDM4 inhibitors can be used to generate and prevent EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>Q, <b>9</b>R</figref>), which highlights plasticity of the copy gains and the ability to therapeutically control DNA amplification with drugs targeting epigenetic factors.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0119">Having therapeutic control of key growth factor receptors could have a profound impact on the ability to control cell proliferation and drug response when delivering inhibitors. Therefore, we tested whether KDM5i would alter cell proliferation when treated with supplemental EGF. Consistent with the previous experiments demonstrating that factors promoting EGFR copy gains increased EGF associated proliferation, KDM5i increased cell proliferation with supplemented EGF when compared to KDM5i alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>S</figref>), which was also observed with KDM5A siRNA depletion, and in turn, was blocked with EGFR siRNA depletion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>T</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>V</figref>). Lastly, we were also able to demonstrate that KDM5i increased the sensitivity to Gefitinib when compared to KDM5i alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>U</figref>), which was consistent with a previous report (53). Taken together, these data highlight the ability to modulate H3K4 methylation in order to harness control of EGFR DNA copy levels, and in turn, growth factor and drug response.</p>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Hypoxia and Epidermal Growth Factor Induce EGFR Amplification</heading>
<p id="p-0125" num="0120">Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that hypoxia directly promoted TSSG formation of chromosome 1 associated loci (e.g., 1q12h) via stabilization of the KDM4A protein, through reduced association with the SKP1-Cull-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex (17). Consistent with this previous observation, 24 hours of exposure to hypoxia was able to stabilize KDM4A in RPE cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>C</figref>) and promote EGFR copy gains that required KDM4A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-<b>11</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>). The hypoxia-induced copy gains of EGFR were transient in nature, in a similar manner to those observed with KDM5i and EZH2i. Indeed, moving cells back to normoxia following 24 hours of hypoxia exposure completely restored EGFR copy number to baseline levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>E, <b>11</b>F</figref>). In agreement with the observation that KDM4A is required for hypoxia-induced EGFR DNA copy gains, pre-treatment of cells with KDM4 family inhibitor prior to hypoxic exposure also blocks hypoxia-induced EGFR copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref>). Furthermore, H3.3 K4M mutant expressing cells did not generate the hypoxia-induced EGFR amplifications (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>H</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>F, <b>12</b>G</figref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that hypoxia promotes EGFR copy gains in a similar fashion to KDM4A overexpression in that the amplifications require increased KDM4A levels and proper targeting via H3K4 methylation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>O</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0121">While investigating hypoxia modulation of EGFR amplification, we also tested whether EGF supplementation would impact EGFR copy gains. A recent report demonstrated that cancer cells with EGFR amplification required EGF supplementation in the media to propagate the copy gains, which raised the possibility that EGF could directly promote EGFR copy gains (54). Consistent with this possibility, we demonstrated that treating cells for 24 hours with 50 ng/ml EGF, the preferred ligand of EGFR, results in significant copy number gains of the EGFR locus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>I, <b>11</b>J</figref>). Furthermore, these gains were entirely dependent on KDM4A as both siRNA-mediated depletion and pharmacological inhibition of the KDM4 family was able to completely suppress these gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>I, <b>11</b>J</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>H-<b>12</b>J</figref>). We also observed increased EGFR transcripts that were reduced upon KDM4 inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>K</figref>). Even though KDM4A was required for both the copy gains and increased expression, we did not observe increased KDM4A protein levels (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>), which suggest another pathway could be promoting KDM4A-dependent copy gains.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0122">Given the importance of H3K4 methylation in targeting KDM4A so that TSSGs occur, we hypothesized that EGF was promoting the TSSGs via the H3K4 KMTs, and in turn, H3K4 methylation. Therefore, we first tested whether H3K4M would block EGF-induced EGFR copy gains. We observed that expression of the methyl-deficient H3K4M mutant was sufficient to block these growth factor-induced copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>L</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>K, <b>12</b>L</figref>). Therefore, we then depleted with two independent siRNAs each of the H3K4 methyltransferases that generated amplification of the EGFR locus (KMT2A, SETD1A, SETD1B; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>M, <b>12</b>N</figref>). Following depletion, cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 24 hours and their EGFR copy number was assessed by DNA FISH. Depletion of KMT2A (MLL1) and SETD1A were able to completely inhibit EGF-induced copy gains of EGFR, whereas depletion of SETD1B had no impact on the amplifications (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>M</figref>). Thus, EGF treatment appears to promote EGFR copy gains through KMT2A, SETD1A and H3K4 methylation, which illustrates how extrinsic cues can promote selective copy gains via specific methyltransferases. Taken together, these data suggest that two different extrinsic cues (hypoxia and EGF) are promoting EGFR copy gains through similar but distinct epigenetic mechanisms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>O</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Epigenetic Dysregulation Combined with Hypoxia or Increased EGF Induce Higher EGFR Copy Number</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0123">We have identified a network of chromatin regulators and physiological signals that influence EGFR copy gains. In the case of hypoxia, KDM4A stabilization mirrors overexpression and promotes EGFR amplification, while EGF appears to promote EGFR amplification through KMT2A/SETD1A and targeting KDM4A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>O</figref>). Therefore, multiple extracellular cues could promote parallel triggers for the amplifications, which raises the question as to whether the combined signals elicit stronger amplification events. In order to test this possibility, cells were exposed to hypoxia for an initial 24 hours, followed by supplementation with EGF (50 ng/ml) under hypoxia conditions for an additional 24 hours. At this point, cells were harvested and their EGFR copy number assessed by DNA FISH. Hypoxia, in combination with EGF, resulted in a modest but additive increase in EGFR DNA copy number (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>). Moreover, an increased percentage of these cells demonstrated higher EGFR DNA copies per nucleus (&#x3e;5 copies; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C</figref>). This observation suggests that hypoxia-induced KDM4A stabilization in concert with EGF-stimulated increases in H3K4 methylation promote EGFR locus plasticity so higher DNA copy numbers are achieved. To strengthen this model, RPE cells that stably overexpress KDM4A, thus mimicking the phenotype observed upon hypoxic exposure, were also treated with EGF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>). EGF treatment of KDM4A overexpressing cells phenocopied the increase in EGFR amplification levels and increased DNA copies per nucleus that were observed in cells treated with hypoxia and EGF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>D-<b>13</b>F</figref>). Moreover, in further support of this model, inhibition of KDM5 or EZH2, both of which increase H3K4me3 at the EGFR locus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>I, <b>9</b>K</figref>), enhance EGFR amplification when combined with hypoxic exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D-<b>14</b>I</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0124">Taken together, our data supports a model by which physiological triggers such as increased EGF concentration and/or hypoxia function in combination with epigenetic perturbation to directly modulate chromatin states and determine whether site-specific low or high copy DNA amplifications occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0039" level="2">Discussion</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0125">To date, little knowledge exists about the molecular mechanisms that promote specific oncogene amplifications. We have uncovered epigenetic regulators and physiologic cues that facilitate amplification of the oncogene EGFR. Moreover, we provide show the ability to rheostat an oncogenic amplification through therapeutic intervention. These data illustrate a molecular basis for EGFR amplification and establish that the extra cellular microenvironment can directly contribute to DNA amplification heterogeneity in both normal and tumor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these copy gains are transient and that combined cues and/or epigenetic factor manipulation are sufficient to promote higher copy number amplifications. Overall, we describe a series of key observations that demonstrate oncogenic amplification is hardwired into cells, providing a definable basis for cellular plasticity for EGFR copy number in both normal and cancer cells, which has significant clinical implications.</p>
<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Specificity, Crosstalk and Methylation States</heading>
<p id="p-0131" num="0126">Prior studies have illustrated that both somatic and tumor cells have extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA; (11,55)) with key oncogenes such as MYC and EGFR occurring as ecDNA in as many as 50% of tumors (11). Early studies on extrachromosomal MYC demonstrated that the ecDNA harbored epigenetic states associated with active gene expression (56). Consistent with these observations, a recent study in somatic cells illustrated that ecDNAs were observed in gene-rich chromosomal regions (55), which suggested a relationship between their generation and actively marked loci. Our s evidence shows that by being able to directly promote or block such modifications through manipulation of histones, histone modifying enzymes and their upstream regulators such as hypoxia. The data presented within this manuscript illustrates a critical role for KMT-KDMs in balancing the methylation states controlling the repressive state (H3K9/27 methylation) and more accessible, active states (H3K4 methylation) so that EGFR amplification is either blocked or promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0127">Methylation states appear to control the predilection of a region to amplify, however, not all enzymes controlling those states are responsible for generating the EGFR amplifications. For example, KDM4A and KDM5A were the only members within their lysine demethylase enzyme families to promote EGFR. However, the KDM6 family members, KDM6A and KDM6B, were both sufficient to generate EGFR amplification upon overexpression, which suggest that these enzymes could have functional redundancy at this locus in controlling H3K27me3 balance. These data highlight that enzyme families could have unique targets, and in certain cases, overlapping specificity.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0128">Similar observations were also true for KMTs targeting H3K4/9 methylation. For example, KMT2A/MLL1, SETD1A and SETD1B promoted EGFR amplification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). SETD1A was not responsible for previously identified TSSGs (10), highlighting the specificity for KMT2 family members in controlling genomic regions undergoing TSSG. Similarly, all H3K9 KMTs except KMT1C/G9a/EHMT2 promoted EGFR copy gains when depleted from cells. The EGFR locus has a clear pattern for the H3K9mel/2/3 distribution across the locus, which suggest an important arrangement for these methylation states and their associated KMTs. In fact, H3K9M introduction promoted EGFR low and higher level copy gains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Therefore, future studies need to interrogate the dependencies of regions on the various members and establish regions that have unique targets or overlapping control.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0129">Data presented here implies that KDM4A utilizes the same mechanism to generate EGFR amplification as other previously mapped regions undergoing copy gains (e.g., 1921.3-CKS1B; (10,17,18)). KDM4A and KDM4B were shown to recruit the replication machinery and facilitate rereplication (10,18). Our previous studies also demonstrated that H3K4 methylation was key to the recruitment of KDM4 family members and the modulation of chromosome 1 targets, which was driven by select H3K4 KMTs (10). These previous studies did not observe a role for H3K27 methylation in controlling the TSSG formation (10,18). However, H3K27me3 was a key modulator of EGFR amplification. Indeed, EZH2 depletion and chemical inhibition promoted EGFR copy gains. EZH2 occupies the blocks of H3K27me3 that flank H3K4 methylation within the EGFR locus. Furthermore, H3K4 methylation interference or depletion of the KMT2 enzymes that control EGFR amplification completely blocked the EGFR copy gains generated by EZH2 suppression or inhibition. These data are consistent with the collection of studies illustrating an antagonistic relationship between these methylation states and the associated enzymes promoting H3K4/27 methylation balance (48). Our data is also consistent with a recent report demonstrating cross-talk between EZH2 and KMT2A disrupts H3K27 methylation balance, resulting in resistance to EZH2i monotherapy (57). Therefore, common principles assigned to gene regulation appear be true for TSSG regulation, which has direct clinical implications.</p>
<heading id="h-0041" level="1">Cues, Epigenetics and Targeting Heterogeneity</heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0130">Previous studies have illustrated EGFR amplification plasticity (12). EGFR copy gains can range from few in number to large clouds in the nuclei of cancer cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; (42)). Glioblastoma patients that received EGFRi have been shown to develop resistance because ecDNA copies of EGFR disappear. However, upon drug removal EGFR ecDNA recurs, reestablishing sensitivity to targeted therapy (12). This plasticity has also been illustrated in cell culture as EGFR copy gains disappear in some cell lines (e.g., GBM cells). A recent study demonstrated however, that supplementing EGF enables propagation of the EGFR amplifications (54). Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms that promote or suppress this amplification event.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0131">Consistent with the prior body of work suggesting certain extracellular cues (hypoxia and EGF) associate with tumor cells harboring EGFR amplification, we have now demonstrated that these stimuli directly control EGFR DNA copy number (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I, <b>13</b></figref>). We observe that hypoxia-induced stabilization (17) and the catalytic activity of KDM4A is a central component in generating EGFR amplification. In fact, KDM4 chemical inhibition was sufficient to reduce this oncogenic amplification in hypoxia-stimulated cells as well as lung cancer cells harboring EGFR ecDNA. This observation is critical because it suggests that targeting KDM4A with small molecules could serve as a novel approach to control EGFR amplification and heterogeneity observed in hypoxic tumors. In addition, amplification of wild type EGFR has been shown to drive acquired resistance to mutation-selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, identifying an additional therapeutic arena for potentially deploying KDM4i therapy (58).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0132">EGF treatment does not impact KDM4A levels but rather triggers EGFR amplification through two specific H3K4 KMTs-KMT2A/MLL1 and SETD1A. While both KMT2A and SETD1A controlled EGF-induced copy gains, SETD1B was dispensable, which highlights that enzymes can be selectively required under certain physiological conditions to generate DNA copy gains. Future studies should address whether other cellular signals or stresses could serve as important triggers to selectively activate or repress the enzymes required to generate amplification at EGFR and other TSSG sites. Understanding the triggers for amplifications will provide insights into tumor heterogeneity and uncover novel biomarkers and drug targets in controlling amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0133">Consistent with these two pathways (hypoxia and EGF) working in parallel, when hypoxia is combined with KDM4A, there is little change in the low copy number (data not shown); however, when combined with increased H3K4 methylation there are higher copy number gains of EGFR per nucleus. The same is true when EGF is combined with KDM4A overexpression. These data illustrate that combining extracellular cues and epigenetic factor alterations promotes EGFR copy number generation and the degree of amplification. Given the range of EGFR amplification across tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), these observations could be important when considering variables impacting DNA copy number plasticity in tumors and when considering ways to therapeutically intervene.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0134">Data presented within this manuscript is suggestive of two populations of EGFR DNA amplifications. For example, in cancer cell lines which exhibit significant DNA amplification of EGFR (e.g. HCC827 or HT-29 cells), these amplifications are reduced by modulation of K4 methylation via the introduction of a H3.3 K4M methyl-deficient mutant, or inhibition/depletion of KDM4A. However, despite a reduction in EGFR DNA amplification under these conditions, significant levels of EGFR amplification remain. Future studies will need to investigate this in more detail, but these results could indicate a balance between integrated DNA copy number amplification and transient extrachromosomal amplifications of EGFR, the latter of which appears targetable with compounds directed towards epigenetic modifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0135">In closing, we have uncovered both chromatin modifiers and extracellular signals that control EGFR amplification and demonstrate that epigenetic therapies could hold a key to modulating EGFR copy number heterogeneity in cancer and associated diseases, which could have significant clinical implications in the future.</p>

<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Clinical Application of Methods for Modulating EGFR Expression Levels for Sensitizing Cancer Cells to EGFR Directed Therapies</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0136">The results described in Example I elucidating the role methylation plays in EGFR DNA amplification have facilitated the design of strategies for treating the individuals based on the level of EGFR amplification in their particular cancer, and their response to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) therapies and related therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0137">The effects of different compounds and their effects to modulate EGFRi therapies are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. This figure, and the data provided herein, show for the first time that EGFR gene DNA copy levels modulateresponse to epidural growth factor or to EGFR inhibitors and thus modulation of EGFR copy number can be used to advantage to sensitize tumor cells to anti-cancer therapies. and KDM4A and the associated complex promoting replication cause the increase in EGFR copy gains when overexpressed or amplified in tumors. For example, HCC827 NSCLC cells have amplified KDM4A at the DNA level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>) and when inhibited, exhibit reduced levels of amplification and reduced growth attributable to the reduced amount of EGFR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>). KDM4A is targeted through the H3K4 methylation controlled by KMT2A, SETD1A and SETD1B. When this methylation is blocked, there is a reduction in EGFR gains. Compositions and methods described herein deplete or chemically suppress KDM4A and thereby prevent the KMT2 enzyme family promoted amplifications. Furthermore, we describe enhancement of methylation and KDM4A-driven EGFR amplification, by suppressing EZH2 and KDM5A. Both enzymes rheostat methylation levels promoting KDM4A to drive amplification of EGFR copy numbers. Therefore, we can increase the copies to enhance a response to either growth factor or EGFR inhibitors by inhibiting these enzymes. This approach increases chemosensitivity and streamlines treatment regimens for the patient. Furthermore, KDM4A suppression would then prevent their ability to cause the EGFR DNA copy gains. These data support the various modulatory approaches for controlling EGFR amplification levels for therapeutic benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0138">One approach for sensitizing tumors to EGFRi or other related RTK therapies includes without limitation, determining the EGFR copy number by DNA FISH or other suitable method and assessing whether increased expression/amplification is present and modulation of copy numbers is in order. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the enzymatic catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that can alter downstream target genes expression by trimethylation of Lys-27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3). We have found that suppression of EZH2 is effective to increase EGFR amplification. EZH2 inhibitors are available, including the EZH1/2 dual inhibitors or inhibitors that disrupt EZH2 function such as EED inhibitors. An exemplary molecule includes tazemetostat by Epizyme. Tumors can be treated with EZH2 inhibitor for a suitable time to amplify the EGFR copy number above base line, followed by treatment EGFRi or related therapies. This strategy is consistent with the amplification levels we observed and the sensitivities previously shown in the colorectal cancer cell lines in Example I. In a similar fashion, KDM5 family or KDM5A specific inhibitors, which are also available, can be used to increase the gain levels and in turn enhance the therapeutic response to EGFRi. In a similar fashion, tumors with diploid copies should be pretreated and then treated with the EGFRi or related therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0139">In certain cases, loss of EGFR DNA copies have been observed in certain tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B</figref>), these tumors can also be targeted with agent to increase EGFR levels/copies, thereby sensitizing the cells to follow on treatment with EGFRi or related therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0140">In other aspects of the methods, the levels of the enzymes that promote the amplifications and prevent the amplifications are assessed at the protein, RNA and cellular localization level as this can guide stratification of treatment. Mutational status can optionally be determined as well. For example, if KDM4A expression is observed to be high, this fining correlates with EGFR amplification, and thus the ability to sensitize the tumor cells to EGFRi. In cases where low EZH2 levels are present, or mis-localization or mutations associated with function (direct or indirect of complex members, facilitating activity) are indicative of the suitability of EGFRi or related therapies. Notably, high EZH2 or KDM5A levels are likely to suppress EGFR copy gains and in turn prevent the response in conditions such as hypoxia. Accordingly, targeting these molecules should also promote amplification and sensitization to EGFRi. KMT2A, SETD1A or SETD1B overexpression also promotes EGFR amplification, rendering cells more sensitive to EGFRi. In cases where H3K9 KMT expression levels are reduced, we expect increased EGFR copies and in turn sensitivity of these tumor types to EGFRi or related therapies. Therefore, targeting these H3K9 KMTs (e.g., EHMT1) can be used to amplify EGFR and sensitize tumors. (80)</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0141">Tumors with very high amplification (e.g., those with &#x3e;8 copies or clouds measured as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>5</b>, and <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>B</figref>), reducing the extrachromosomal DNA or DNA copies will reduce the amount of response. In such cases, it is desirable to increase the homogeneity of EGFR expression levels throughout the tumor. Intratumor heterogeneity for EGFR DNA copy gains is then reduced so that a more uniform response to the EGFRi can be achieved. In such cases, treatment with KDM4 family or KDM4A-selective inhibition would promote reduced heterogeneity and more consistent response to the therapies over time. Inhibition of these molecules can be achieved at the nucleic acid or protein levels. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0142">In a similar fashion, our data documents the plasticity of EGFR based on hypoxia and/or EGF, therefore, KDM4 family or KDM4A selective inhibitors can be used to reduce the EGFR heterogeneity within a tumor in order to achieve a more consistent response. Thus, in these types of tumors, one can also drive gains even higher through EZH2i or KDM5i in order to sensitize the tumor to drug.</p>
