<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, an offensive odor-suppressing composition for reducing the offensiveness of age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, as well as a flavor composition for reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ambient odors and offensive odors perceived as unpleasant in daily life are strongly desired to be eliminated more effectively for improved living environments. In recent years, there has been growing awareness of body odors, among others. Further, food and beverage products are known to produce off-odors (off-flavors) over time, which in turn reduce the quality of the food and beverage products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Body odors are broadly divided into two categories, i.e., the &#x201c;smell of each body part&#x201d; (e.g., mouth odor, foot odor, underarm odor, scalp odor) and the &#x201c;combined smell arising from the body trunk.&#x201d; The &#x201c;combined smell arising from the body trunk&#x201d; is known to change with age, and age-related body odors, which are observed at middle age or later, very strongly tend to be disfavored. As to substances responsible for causing such age-related body odors, unsaturated aldehydes such as trans-2-nonenal and trans-2-octenal have been reported to cause age-related body odors (Patent Literature 1). Moreover, vinyl ketones such as 1-octen-3-one and 1,5-octadien-3-one have a very low odor threshold and a strong metallic odor, and are reported to be greatly involved in underarm odors (Non-patent Literature 1). Moreover, nonenal, 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one and so on are also known as off-flavors (Patent Literatures 2 and 3, Non-patent Literature 2).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Selective odor elimination techniques based on antagonistic mechanism are designed to search for olfactory receptors responding to particular odorous substances and to suppress their activation with particular substances, and the potential of these techniques is becoming clear. For example, olfactory receptor OR2W1 responds to hexanoic acid, which is among offensive odors. Substances inhibiting the activity of this OR2W1 are exemplified by florhydral, and florhydral has been reported to suppress an offensive odor induced by hexanoic acid in sensory testing (Patent Literature 4).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0011">Screening may be possible for candidate substances for offensive odor-suppressing materials when olfactory receptors responding to known offensive odor-causing substances are searched and used for this purpose. However, such olfactory receptors responding to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol have not been widely known so far.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">Under these circumstances, there has been a desire to search for olfactory receptors responding to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol, and thereby provide a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, and also provide an offensive odor-suppressing composition for reducing the offensiveness of age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, as well as a flavor composition for reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">As a result of extensive and intensive efforts made to solve the problems stated above, the inventors of the present invention have succeeded in newly identifying olfactory receptors responding respectively to one or more offensive odor-causing substances selected from the group consisting of 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol and 1,5-octadien-3-ol. The inventors of the present invention have made further studies and have found that the use of these olfactory receptors enables the evaluation and selection of materials suppressing age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, and materials reducing off-flavors, as well as materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, by means of the masking effect of olfactory receptor antagonists. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that antagonist candidate compounds suppressing the response of these olfactory receptors including OR2C1 and OR4Q3 are excellent not only in the effect of suppressing age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, but also in the effect of reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">Namely, the present invention provides a screening method for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor, an offensive odor-suppressing composition for reducing the offensiveness of age-related body odors and/or underarm odors, as well as a flavor composition for reducing off-flavors derived from food and beverage products, as shown below.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">The method of the present invention allows screening for candidate substances for materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor. The screening method of the present invention can be expected to contribute to the development of materials suppressing one or more offensive odors selected from the group consisting of a 1-octen-3-one odor, a 1,5-octadien-3-one odor, a 1-octen-3-ol odor and a 1,5-octadien-3-ol odor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">Moreover, when attempting to develop new fragrance or flavor materials, there are problems of olfactory fatigue and variations among individuals if many candidate substances are evaluated for their odor by the human olfactory sense alone; and hence the proper selection of candidate substances may involve difficulties. According to the method of the present invention, such problems can be overcome or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">Further, according to a preferred aspect of the present invention, when a group of antagonist candidate compounds suppressing the response of OR2C1 and/or OR4Q3 are used in combination with a group of particular compounds conventionally used as fragrances or flavorings, etc., a greater suppressive effect may be provided on offensive odors than when the group of antagonist candidate compounds are used alone.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0041">&#x3c;Step (i)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">In step (i), an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of OR2C1, OR4Q3, and polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more with the amino acid sequence of any of these polypeptides and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one is brought into contact with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">The olfactory receptor polypeptide to be used for this purpose is an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of OR2C1, OR4Q3, and polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more with the amino acid sequence of any of these polypeptides and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">OR2C1 has been registered in GenBank under NM_012368, and is a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) encoded by DNA at positions 53 to 991 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0046">Since these polypeptides strongly and selectively respond to 1-octen-3-one, the screening method using OR2C1 and/or OR4Q3 can be expected to contribute to the development of 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">As an olfactory receptor, it is also possible to use an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, even more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 98% or more with the amino acid sequence possessed by any of these polypeptides (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4) and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-one.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">Such olfactory receptor polypeptides may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">In the present invention, there is no particular limitation on how to contact an olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1-octen-3-one to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide to 1-octen-3-one. For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-one on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-one on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. The time required to contact the olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1-octen-3-one is not determined exactly because it also depends on the concentration of 1-octen-3-one and the method used for measurement. However, the response may be measured immediately after their contact, and the time required for their contact is usually 0 to 4 hours, and preferably 2 to 4 hours. The same goes for when the olfactory receptor polypeptide is contacted with 1-octen-3-one in admixture with a test substance.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">Cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be prepared when cells are transformed with a vector carrying a gene encoding the olfactory receptor polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">In a preferred aspect of the present invention, the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin may be integrated together with the olfactory receptor polypeptide.

<p id="p-0049" num="0054">Moreover, instead of bovine rhodopsin, it is also possible to use a polypeptide which comprises an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, even more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 98% or more with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 and which is capable of facilitating cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">It should be noted that amino acid residues of not only bovine rhodopsin but also any other polypeptides may be used as long as they can facilitate cell membrane expression of the olfactory receptor polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">There is no particular limitation on how to measure the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide, and any technique used in the art may be used for this purpose. For example, it is known that once an odorous compound has bound to an olfactory receptor polypeptide, G protein in cells will be activated and this G protein will in turn activate adenylate cyclase to convert ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), thereby increasing the intracellular level of cAMP. Thus, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide can be measured when the level of cAMP is measured. The level of cAMP may be measured using ELISA techniques, reporter gene assay techniques, etc. Above all, it is preferred that the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be evaluated on the basis of the fold increase value determined by dividing the results measured in the presence of 1-octen-3-one by the results measured in the absence of 1-octen-3-one. For example, when the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase), evaluation can be made using 1-octen-3-one at a concentration which gives a fold increase value of preferably 2 or more, more preferably 4 or more, and even more preferably 10 or more.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0064">In such a way as described above, test substances can be screened to select candidate substances for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. According to the present invention, it is possible to select candidate substances for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials from among many test substances, without causing any problems such as olfactory fatigue and variations among individuals associated with sensory testing by means of the human olfactory sense.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">The selected substances can be used as candidate substances for 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials. If necessary, the selected substances may be subjected to modifications or the like to thereby develop novel compounds having the most suitable scent. Further, the selected substances may be blended with other fragrance or flavor materials to thereby develop fragrance or flavor materials capable of suppressing the 1-octen-3-one odor and also having the most suitable scent. The screening method of the present invention can be used to contribute to the development of new fragrance or flavor materials serving as 1-octen-3-one odor-suppressing materials.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0112">As an olfactory receptor, it is also possible to use an olfactory receptor polypeptide selected from the group consisting of polypeptides which comprise an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, even more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 98% or more with the amino acid sequence possessed by any of these polypeptides (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4) and which are responsive to 1-octen-3-ol.</p>

For example, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-ol on cells isolated from a living body expressing the olfactory receptor polypeptide, or alternatively, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide may be measured by being contacted with 1-octen-3-ol on cells genetically engineered to artificially express the olfactory receptor polypeptide. The time required to contact the olfactory receptor polypeptide with 1-octen-3-ol is not determined exactly because it also depends on the concentration of 1-octen-3-ol and the method used for measurement. However, the response may be measured immediately after their contact, and the time required for their contact is usually 0 to 4 hours, and preferably 2 to 4 hours.

Thus, the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide can be measured when the level of cAMP is measured. The level of cAMP may be measured using ELISA techniques, reporter gene assay techniques, etc. Above all, it is preferred that the response of the olfactory receptor polypeptide is measured by reporter gene assay techniques using a luminophore (e.g., luciferase).</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="2">(1) Cloning of Olfactory Receptor Genes</heading>
<p id="p-0186" num="0188">Human olfactory receptor genes were obtained by PCR cloning with Human Genomic DNA: Female (Promega) on the basis of their sequence information registered in GenBank. Into pME18S vectors, the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of bovine rhodopsin were integrated and the resulting human olfactory receptor genes were integrated respectively downstream thereof to obtain human olfactory receptor gene expression vectors.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="2">(2) Expression of Olfactory Receptor Genes in HEK293T Cells</heading>
<p id="p-0187" num="0189">Each human olfactory receptor gene expression vector (0.05 &#x3bc;g), RTP1S vector (0.01 &#x3bc;g), firefly luciferase vector pGL4.29 containing a cAMP response element promoter (Promega, 0.01 &#x3bc;g) and <i>Renilla </i>luciferase vector pGL4.74 containing a thymidine kinase promoter (Promega, 0.005 &#x3bc;g) were dissolved in 10 &#x3bc;L of Opti-MEMI (gibco) to give a gene solution (for one well). HEK293T cells were seeded in 100 &#x3bc;L volumes into 96-well plates (Biocoat, Corning) at a cell density reaching confluence after 24 hours, and the gene solutions were added to the respective wells to cause gene transfer into the cells by lipofection techniques in accordance with the usage of Lipofectamine 3000, followed by culture at 37&#xb0; C. under a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere for 24 hours.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="2">(3) Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay</heading>
