<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process is generally used in the processing of high performance titanium, zirconium, nickel based alloys and steel, among other alloys. Generally, a VAR system gradually melts an electrode by an electric current that flows through the electrode and arcs to molten metal contained within a crucible. The applied melting current is varied during the process, to achieve the desired molten metal pool geometry. At times, the electric arc can cause beads of metal to spatter onto portions of the crucible wall that are above the molten metal. These portions are cold and can solidify the beads into a porous nonhomogeneous mass, which can cause surface irregularities in the ingot. Issues related to VAR ingot surface quality and internal quality, and other issues are addressed by the present disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To address the surface irregularities of the formed ingot, a VAR system may include large stationary coils in a Helmholtz configuration that are arranged around a crucible. The stationary coils extend along the entire length of the crucible and are used to generate a transverse magnetic field. Such VAR system is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,745 which is commonly assigned with the present application and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the VAR system having the Helmholtz configured coils may reduce surface irregularities, the coils have to be placed a significant distance away from the crucible. In addition, due to their large size, the coils require more power to generate the required magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, a VAR system of the present disclosure includes an electromagnetic energy source and a lift mechanism for moving the electromagnetic energy source with the growing molten metal (i.e., ingot), such that the magnetic field is localized. In one form, the electromagnetic energy source is a compact coil assembly, and as described further herein, in one form, the coil assembly includes a ring shaped magnetic core, made up of a high permeability material and wound with insulated wires. The coil assembly is operable to generate a rotating magnetic field that is perpendicular to the normal axis of the coil assembly. This rotating magnetic field generated interacts with the melting current to move the arc radially in a direction perpendicular to the normal axis of the electrode and ingot.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the lift mechanism is illustrated and described as moving the electromagnetic energy source relative to the ingot, it should also be understood that the ingot may be moved relative to the electromagnetic energy source, or both the electromagnetic energy source and the ingot may move while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One form of the VAR system of the present disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a VAR system <b>100</b>, which may also be referred to as a VAR furnace, is used to gradually melt an electrode <b>102</b> to form an ingot <b>104</b>, which has a pool of molten metal <b>103</b>. In one form, the VAR system includes a crucible assembly <b>106</b>, a coil assembly <b>108</b> (i.e., electromagnetic energy source) arranged about the crucible assembly <b>106</b>, and a lift mechanism <b>110</b> for moving the coil assembly <b>108</b> along an exterior of the crucible assembly <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The crucible assembly <b>106</b> accommodates the electrode <b>102</b> and holds the ingot <b>104</b> formed from the electrode <b>102</b>. In one form, the crucible assembly <b>106</b> includes a crucible <b>112</b> (&#x201c;crucible&#x201d; hereinafter) and a cooling member <b>114</b> that defines a chamber <b>116</b> around the crucible <b>112</b> for receiving a coolant, such as water, to reduce the temperature of the crucible <b>112</b>. Other suitable systems for cooling the crucible may also be used and are within the scope of the present disclosure. The crucible <b>112</b> and the cooling member <b>114</b> may be made of nonmagnetic material such as cooper and stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">During the remelting process, electrical arcs that function to melt the electrode <b>102</b> extend between the electrode <b>102</b> and an inner wall of the crucible <b>112</b>, generally defining an arc region <b>105</b> as shown. Advantageously, as described in greater detail below, the magnetic fields generated by an electromagnetic energy source are localized to this arc region <b>105</b> (or in other words, limited to this arc region <b>105</b> rather than along the entire crucible <b>112</b>, or a substantial portion thereof) during remelting, thereby resulting in improved surface quality of the ingot <b>104</b> and reducing the amount of electrode remnant at the end of the remelting process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The coil assembly <b>108</b> is positioned adjacent to the crucible <b>112</b> assembly and moves along a longitudinal axis <b>2</b> of the crucible <b>112</b>, the crucible assembly <b>106</b>, and the ingot <b>104</b> as the ingot <b>104</b> grows. The coil assembly includes a core <b>120</b> with plurality of coils <b>122</b> wrapped around the core <b>120</b>. As described further below, the core <b>120</b> and the coils <b>122</b> are operable to form a transverse magnetic field that is substantially confined to a gap between the electrode <b>102</b> and the ingot <b>104</b>. In one form, the core <b>120</b> is a ring-shaped toroid with a rectangular cross-section and is constructed by stacking layers of a high permeability ferromagnetic material, such as annealed electrical steel. The core can be configured in other suitable shapes and material and should not be limited to the examples provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The coils <b>122</b> may be an insulated solid copper wire or a hollow copper tube that is wound around the core <b>120</b>. The windings are split to form one or more coil pairs, where coils of a coil pair are arranged on opposite sides of the core <b>120</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the coil assembly <b>108</b> includes three coil pairs (e.g., coil pair A-A&#x2032;; coil pair B-B&#x2032;; and coil pair C-C&#x2032;), where the coils of each pair are arranged on opposite sides of the core. Each coil pair is configured to receive a sinusoidal current, with the current in each pair being 120&#xb0; out of phase. The direction of the magnetic field from each pair is represented by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To control the current through the coil assembly <b>108</b> and thus, control the magnetic field, the VAR system <b>100</b> further comprises a coil current controller. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a coil current controller <b>130</b> includes a microcontroller <b>132</b>, at least one H-bridge for each coil pair (e.g., H-bridges <b>134</b>A, <b>134</b>B, and <b>134</b>C for coil pairs B-B&#x2032;; and C-C&#x2032;, respectively), and one or more DC power supplies <b>136</b>. The H-bridges <b>134</b>A, <b>134</b>B, and <b>134</b>C may collectively be referred to as H-bridges <b>134</b>. The H-bridges <b>134</b> enable bi-directional current flow in the respective coil pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The microcontroller <b>132</b> is programmed to control the magnetic field by controlling the current through the coil pairs. More particularly, the maximum current, which also limits the maximum magnetic field that can be generated, is determined based on a ratio of a power supply voltage from the DC power supply <b>136</b> and a resistance of the coils <b>122</b>. The current in each coil pair at any instant is given by Equations 1-3 below, where V<sub>o </sub>is the power supply voltage, R is the resistance of each coil pair, co is the angular frequency (i.e., &#x3c9;=2&#x3c0;f), and t is time.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0035">The externally imposed magnetic field is largely confined to the gap between the electrode and ingot and causes the arc between the electrode and the ingot to move toward the wall of the crucible <b>112</b>. By cycling the electric current through the coils in a sinusoidal fashion with proper phase angle offsets, a rotating magnetic field is generated. The direction of rotation of the arc (e.g., clockwise or counter clockwise) is controlled based on the sequence at which the coils are energized, and the rate of the rotation is dependent on the frequency of electrical energization of the coils. In addition, by controlling the current through the coil pairs, a suitable magnetic field can be generated to control the position of the arc. That is, the magnetic field interacts with a melting DC current to generate a force (F) on the arc, which is defined in Equation 5, where J is applied current density, and B is the magnetic flux density.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0036">By selecting appropriate process set-points (e.g., coil resistance, power supply, phase angle offset, others), the arc is swept along the circumference of the ingot, which, in turn, helps improve the smoothness of the ingot surface.</p>

With continuous reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the lift mechanism <b>110</b> includes a platform <b>150</b> upon with the coil assembly <b>108</b> is positioned, and one or more drive motors <b>152</b> that are operable to gradually move the platform <b>150</b> having the coil assembly <b>108</b>. In one form, the platform <b>150</b> is an insulated plate that is attached to four posts <b>154</b>, where each post is controlled by a drive motor <b>152</b> for moving the platform <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0038">To control the lift mechanism <b>110</b>, the VAR system <b>100</b> further includes a lift drive controller. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in one form, a lift drive controller <b>160</b> includes a microcontroller <b>162</b>, one H-bridge <b>164</b> for each drive motor <b>152</b>, where the H-bridges <b>164</b> are coupled to a DC power supply (e.g., 12V). The microcontroller <b>162</b> is programmed to adjust the height of the lift mechanism <b>110</b> based on a height of the ingot melt, which can be determined based on characteristics associated with the ingot. For example, in one form, the VAR system <b>100</b> is equipped with load cells, and thus the ingot height (h) can be estimated using the relationship set out in Equation 6 in which &#x3c1;<sub>i </sub>is the density of ingot, A<sub>i </sub>is the area of ingot, and {dot over (m)} is the melt rate. Alternatively, if the VAR system does not include load cells, the ingot height can be estimated from the travel amount of the electrode (i.e., a ram travel) which is provided by Equation 7, in which X is the ram travel, &#x3c1;<sub>e </sub>is the density of electrode, and A<sub>e </sub>is the area of electrode. The variables in Equations 6 and 7 can be inputted to the microcontroller <b>162</b> and are represented as furnace inputs in the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0039">Based on the foregoing, in operation, the VAR system <b>100</b> includes the coil assembly <b>108</b> that is compact and moveable by the lift mechanism <b>110</b>, such that the coil assembly <b>108</b> travels as the ingot grows. The coil assembly <b>108</b> is operable to generate a localized rotating magnetic field for forming a rotating arc between the electrode and the ingot. Specifically, the magnetic field interacts with the arc plasma to accelerate it radially (i.e., perpendicular the normal axis of the electrode), thereby moving it towards the crucible. This action, in turn has a positive impact on the ingot surface quality since the thermal energy from the arc removes (melts) the splatter on the crucible, and hence as the ingot grows, it solidifies on a bare crucible, and not on a shell of splatter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0040">The compact design of the coil assembly enables easy retrofitting to existing VAR furnaces and requires minimal clearance around the crucible assembly. In addition, due to the compact size of the coil assembly, the voltage and current necessary to generate the magnetic field are relatively small compared to systems having larger coils that generate the magnetic field throughout the crucible. While the coil assembly is described as having three coil pairs, the scope of the present disclosure is applicable to multiple coil pairs and should not be limited to three.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0041">The VAR system of the present disclosure is configured to position and control the arc towards the surface of the ingot and thus, significantly improve the ingot surface quality. Since, the coil traverses the arc, the external transverse field is applied only to the arc region and not to the molten metal pool. This in turn aids in obtaining the desired molten metal pool shape by confining effects of applied magnetic field to the proximity of the arc. In addition, by altering the arc behavior at the end of the process, the amount of electrode remnant, can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0042">In addition to controlling the coil assembly to manage the surface integrity of the ingot and the remnant shape and weight, the VAR system of the present disclosure may also be used during the melting to control the arc location, and thus, impact the overall pool shape, thereby improving the solidification structure. A further use could be during early stages of vacuum arc melting known as start up to reduce the time for startup and to improve the overall integrity of the base. In fact, any approach where the coil arrangement and control approach can be used to manage the arc location over time to yield beneficial effects can be envisioned and is within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0043">The coil current controller and the lift controller may be collectively referred to as a control system of the VAR system. While the coil current controller and the lift controller are described as having independent microcontrollers, one microcontroller may be configured to perform the operations of the coil current controller and the lift controller.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0044">The algorithm for the coil current controller may be incorporated into existing PLC based VAR control systems using a text-based programing language. Alternatively, the coil current controller can be a standalone system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0045">The field strength and rotation (RPM) are software parameters that can be readily varied during different stages of a typical melt. For example, parameters can be customized for each of the following stages of heating: a startup stage, a steady state, and a hot top stage. The field strength, and rotation (RPM) can also be adjusted based on the type of alloy being melted, associated arc gap, and annulus distance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0046">In an experimental implementation of a VAR system of the present disclosure, a coil assembly was arranged around a 203 mm (eight-inch) VAR furnace with a 25.4 mm (one-inch) gap provided between the coil assembly and the furnace. The coil assembly had an internal diameter of 381 mm (15 inches), an outer diameter of 432 mm (17 inches), and a height of 76 mm (three inches). The coil assembly was formed by stacking 0.254 mm (0.01 inch) thick sheets of industrial grade electrical steel to form the core, and three layers of 1 mm (18 gauge) insulated copper wire was wound around the core.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0047">In one experimental finding, an electric current in the range of 0 to 1.6 A, and a voltage in the range of 0 to 10 V was sufficient to generate a maximum magnetic field of 20 G per coil pair at the center of the crucible, and a net field of 30G. The arc was rotated at 2 to 5 RPM, with increment angles in the range of 1 to 15 degrees with reversals every 5 minutes. A plot of the three sinusoidal current waveforms during the test is show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Under these test conditions, in order to tract the ingot height, the lift mechanism was moved in the range of 0 to 0.5 min/min. This experimental implementation is provided to further illustrate the operation of the VAR assembly of the present disclosure and is not intended to limit the VAR assembly to parameters described in the experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0048">The description of the disclosure is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the substance of the disclosure are intended to be within the scope of the disclosure. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p>
