<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A tanning agent-free leather making method is provided. A raw hide is subjected to controllable dehydration with a molecular sieve-polar organic solvent composite dehydration media to achieve a dehydrated hide, and then a tanning agent-free leather is prepared by increasing the surface roughness of the dehydrated hide and reducing the surface energy of the dehydrated hide. The present disclosure does not use any metal or non-metal tanning agent, which is eco-friendly. The present disclosure breaks the balance of water distribution between the raw hide and the polar organic solvent, which realizes a multi-medium self-driven directional controllable dehydration of the raw hide, effectively solving the problems during dehydration of the raw hide only using polar organic solvent. The molecular sieve-polar organic solvent dehydration system is easy to recover and can be recycled for the controllable dehydration of the raw hide multiple times. Therefore, a brand-new clean leather making technology is provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the technical field of leather making, and in particular to a tanning agent-free leather making method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chrome tanning has always been the most commonly used method in the leather making (Yao Q, Chen H, Jiao Q, et al. Hydroxyl-Terminated Dendrimer Acting as a High Exhaustion Agent for Chrome Tanning[J]. <i>Chemistry Select, </i>2018, 3 (4): 1032-1039. Ding W, Cheng Y, Wang Y, et al. Chrome-reduced Combination Tanning for Cleaner Dyed Sheep Fur Processing[J]<i>. Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, </i>2015, 110 (11): 363-371). However, during a chrome tanning process, a large amount of chromium salts, sulfates, and chlorides are needed. In addition, trivalent chromium Cr (III) has the risk of being oxidized into hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) during the post-tanning procedures such as neutralization, fatliquoring, and dyeing as well as the storage process (Tang Y, Zhou J, Zeng Y, et al. Effect of Leather Chemicals on Cr (III) Removal From Post Tanning Wastewater[J]<i>. Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, </i>2018, 113 (3). Hedberg Y S, Liden C. Chromium (III) and Chromium (VI) Release From Leather During 8 Months of Simulated Use[J]. <i>Contact Dermatitis, </i>2016, 75 (2): 82-88), and the hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) is extremely harmful to the environment and human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an eco-friendly chrome-free tanning technology, so as to fundamentally eliminate the environmental risk of chrome tanning technology.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, a variety of chrome-free tanning agents have been developed for leather making, mainly including chrome-free metal tanning agents (such as titanium, zirconium, and aluminum tanning agents) and chrome-free non-metal tanning agents (such as vegetable tanning agents, aldehyde tanning agents, and synthetic tanning agents) (Liu B, Wei Z, Wang Y, et al. Preparation of Oxidized Poly (2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) with Multiple Aldehyde Groups by TEMPO-mediated Oxidation for Gelatin Crosslinking[J]<i>. Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association, </i>2019, 114 (5): 163-170). However, the property of chrome-free leather prepared by any one of the above-mentioned tanning agents is significantly inferior to that of chrome-tanned leather. For example, zirconium-tanned leather is stiff and has poor softness, aluminum-tanned leather is not washable, and aldehyde-tanned leather is not suitable for long-term storage and is prone to yellowing (Li K, Liao X, Zhou J, et al. Experimental Study on Tanning of Yellow Cowhide with Combination of Carboxyl-containing Aromatic Synthetic Tanning agent and Aluminum Sulfate [J]<i>. Journal of Leather Science and Engineering, </i>2017, 27 (3): 5-11. Shi B, Di Y, Song L, et al. Chemical Modification of Tanning Extract and Use of Product Thereof in Chrome-free or Chrome-less Tanning [J]. <i>China Leather, </i>2001, 30 (9): 3-8). In summary, the cross-linking theory-based chrome-free tanning methods currently developed still cannot replace the traditional chrome tanning method. Moreover, the above-mentioned chrome-free tanning technology also leads to a large amount of tanning wastewater and causes pollution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Compared with a raw hide, leather has a significantly reduced water content and significantly improved dispersion degree of collagen fibers. Therefore, the tanning agent-free leather making method, where a raw hide is dehydrated to reduce the water content and disperse the collagen fibers, has become a new development direction of chrome free leather making. Polar organic solvents have a dehydration effect. Thus, it is an important tanning agent-free leather making method to directly dehydrate a raw hide by polar organic solvent, and then conduct a hydrophobic treatment by increasing the surface roughness of the dehydrated hide and reducing the surface energy of the dehydrated hide (Huang X, He X, Shi B. Preparation Method of Chrome-free Leather with Hydrophobic and Highly-dispersed Hide Fiber Structures [P]. Sichuan Province: CN109234476A; and Shi B, He X, Zhou J, Wang Y, Zeng Y. Preparation Method of Dehydrated Hide [P]. Sichuan Province: CN109385493A). However, when a polar organic solvent is used to dehydrate a raw hide, the dehydration performance of the polar organic solvent is significantly reduced after the water in the raw hide is gradually removed and enters the polar organic solvent. With the progress of dehydration, the water distribution between the polar organic solvent and the raw hide reaches a balance, and it is necessary to replace the used polar organic solvent with a fresh polar organic solvent to further remove the water remaining in the raw hide. Therefore, the dehydration of a raw hide by using a polar organic solvent requires the multi-replacement of the polar organic solvent to achieve a prominent dehydration effect. In addition, a polar organic solvent used in dehydration has a high water content and cannot be reused for dehydration of a raw hide, which causes the problems of low solvent utilization and solvent emission. Furthermore, in the existing tanning agent-free leather making technology, the surface roughness of a dehydrated hide is enhanced through in-situ hydrolysis to achieve a hydrophobic treatment, and the accurate control of a degree of the in-situ hydrolysis is required, which is not conducive to industrial scale-up. At present, there is an urgent need to solve the above-mentioned bottleneck problems of tanning agent-free leather making.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the problems in the background, the present disclosure provides a tanning agent-free leather making method.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A tanning agent-free leather making method is provided, including subjecting a raw hide to controllable dehydration with molecular sieve-polar organic solvent composite dehydration media.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the polar organic solvent includes, but is not limited to, any one or a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and acetone.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the raw hide includes, but is not limited to, cowhide and sheepskin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, a weight of the polar organic solvent used is 2.0 to 8.0 times a weight of the raw hide, and a weight of the molecular sieve used is 2.0 to 8.0 times the weight of the raw hide.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the molecular sieve and the polar organic solvent are added in the order as follows: adding the molecular sieve and the polar organic solvent together to dehydrate the raw hide; or adding the polar organic solvent first to dehydrate the raw hide, and then adding the molecular sieve to reach a combined dehydration action.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, after subjecting the raw hide to controllable dehydration, the method further includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">drying a dehydrated hide obtained after the controllable dehydration to obtain a crust;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">subjecting the crust to a hydrophobic treatment; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">drying a hide obtained after the hydrophobic treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, a method of the hydrophobic treatment includes:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">dispersing an oxide in a solvent to obtain a suspension, applying the suspension to a surface of the crust through suction filtration, drying the hide, and immersing the hide in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution, where the oxide is any one selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and magnesium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, a weight of the oxide is 8.0% to 20% of a weight of the crust; a weight of the solvent is 10 to 16 times the weight of the crust; and a weight of the PDMS is 5.0 to 12 times the weight of the crust.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, after subjecting the raw hide to controllable dehydration, the method further includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">separating the molecular sieve from the polar organic solvent after the controllable dehydration;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">subjecting the separated molecular sieve to a thermal treatment for activation; and</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, a product obtained by compositing the molecular sieve activated by the thermal treatment with the separated polar organic solvent is reused for the controllable dehydration of a raw hide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The molecular sieve used in the present disclosure is a porous material, which has excellent water adsorption capacity and stable properties and is easy to recycle. The molecular sieve used in the dehydration of the raw hide can selectively remove the water entering the polar organic solvent, such that the balance between the water remaining in the raw hide and the water entering the dehydration solvent is broken and the water remaining in the raw hide can be continuously removed and transferred to the polar organic solvent, which achieves a one-step controllable dehydration of water in the raw hide without solvent replacement, and solves the problem that the dehydration by using only polar organic solvent requires the multi-replacement of the solvent. Moreover, the molecular sieve is easily separated and recovered from the polar organic solvent after being used for dehydration, and the recovered molecular sieve can be activated by a thermal treatment and then reused together with the separated and recovered polar organic solvent for raw hide dehydration, thereby realizing the recycling of the polar organic solvent and the molecular sieve for the controllable dehydration of the raw hide. In addition, the method for improving the surface roughness of the dehydrated hide by applying the oxide to the surface of the dehydrated hide through suction filtration has the advantages of convenience, high efficiency, and easy industrial scale-up.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method provided by the present disclosure does not use any metal or non-metal tanning agent, which is eco-friendly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The controllable dehydration leather making method provided by the present disclosure breaks the balance of water distribution between the raw hide and the polar organic solvent, and realizes a multi-medium self-driven directional controllable dehydration of the raw hide where the water moves from the raw hide to the polar organic solvent and further into the molecular sieve, promoting the continuous and controllable dehydration of water in the raw hide, and effectively solving the problems during dehydration of the raw hide using a single polar organic solvent, namely, the dehydration efficiency is low, and the polar organic solvent needs to be changed multiple times for dehydration and is difficult to be recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the method provided by the present disclosure, the used solvent does not require purification, and can be directly reused with the molecular sieve activated by a thermal treatment for tanning agent-free leather making, which not only significantly reduces the leather making cost, but also greatly improves the cleanliness of the leather making process and the eco-friendliness of the leather product.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The leather making method provided by the present disclosure does not require traditional leather making procedures such as tanning and retaining, instead, the leather making method involves a simple operation and a short leather making time, which remarkably improves the leather making efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Tanning Agent-Free Leather Making</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A raw hide (cowhide) was subjected to dehydration for 90 min in anhydrous ethanol (a weight of the anhydrous ethanol was 6.0 times a weight of the raw hide), then an activated molecular sieve powder (3A) (a weight of the activated molecular sieve powder was 3.5 times the weight of the raw hide) was added to allow further dehydration for 120 min to obtain a dehydrated hide, and a water content of the dehydrated hide was determined by the Karl Fischer method to be 2.95%.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dehydrated hide was dried to obtain a crust, and the softness of the crust was determined to be 4.69 mm according to GB/T 39371-2020, as shown in Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Silicon dioxide (a weight of the silicon dioxide was 10% of a weight of the crust) was dispersed in anhydrous ethanol (a weight of the anhydrous ethanol was 10 times the weight of the crust) to obtain a suspension, then the suspension was applied to a surface of the crust through suction filtration, and then the hide was dried and soaked in a 10 wt % PDMS solution (a weight of the PDMS solution was 8.0 times the weight of the crust) for 5.0 min to complete a hydrophobic treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A hide obtained after the hydrophobic treatment was dried to obtain tanning agent-free leather. A picture of the tanning agent-free leather prepared in this example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Recovery of the used molecular sieve and polar organic solvent:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A mixture of ethanol and the activated molecular sieve powder (3A) after being used for preparing the dehydrated hide in this example was subjected to separation to obtain a liquid at an upper layer and a solid at a lower layer, where the liquid was ethanol with a low water content of 0.97%, which could be directly reused for the tanning agent-free leather making of the present disclosure; and the solid was a 3A molecular sieve powder, which could be reused for the tanning agent-free leather making of the present disclosure after being activated at 300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A water contact angle of a grain surface of the tanning agent-free leather prepared in this example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, and a water contact angle of a flesh surface of the tanning agent-free leather is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, both of which indicate a superhydrophobic effect. The pore structure parameters of the tanning agent-free leather are shown in Table 1. The mechanical performance parameters of the tanning agent-free leather are shown in Table 2. According to Table 1, the tanning agent-free leather prepared in this example has a porosity of 45.82&#xb1;4.75%, an average pore size of 590.97&#xb1;174.12 nm, and a total pore area of 4.28&#xb1;1.11 m<sup>2</sup>/g. According to the pore size distribution in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, pore sizes of the tanning agent-free leather prepared in this example are mainly distributed in a range of 6,000 nm to 15,000 nm.
