<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to coatings and, more particularly, to oxidation protection coatings.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gas turbine engines and hypersonic engines that are currently being pursued for enhanced performance and improved operational efficiencies will require stable lightweight materials with robust mechanical properties across a wide temperature spectrum. Due to these stringent demands, only a limited number of refractory materials such as carbon or ceramic materials, carbon fiber or silicon carbide fiber based composites, monolithic ceramics such as silicon nitride and silicon carbide, and refractory based alloys such as those based on molybdenum and niobium can be used. While possessing adequate high temperature mechanical properties, these materials suffer from inadequate high temperature oxidation resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Silicon based non-oxide ceramics, such as SiC/SiC CMCs, monolithic silicon nitride and silicon carbide are attractive high temperature materials for gas turbine applications. These materials may exhibit material recession in the gas turbine combustion environment. The recession mechanism responsible for silicon-based material is accelerated oxidation and material loss caused by high partial pressure of water vapor in combustion environments. Their mechanical properties deteriorate as a result of oxidation and recession. An environmental barrier coating is therefore required to provide protection from the accelerated attack by water vapor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical oxidation protective coatings define a viscosity range that will allow the glass to flow at high temperature, but this may not be practical in gas turbine applications where coating durability is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The oxidation resistant bond coat layer of the present application protects materials from oxidation in a range of temperatures from room temperature to up to at least 3000 F (1650 C) and greater. The oxidation resistant bond coat layer provides a metal silicide network in a healing matrix. The interstices between the metal silicide network is filled with and coated by silica based healing matrix containing glass phases to protect the substrate and provide the healing function. In embodiments, there is minimal porosity in the oxidation resistant bond coat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The two phases, the metal silicide network and the glass containing silica based healing matrix, are interwound. The glass phases in the silica healing matrix melt at high temperature to seal cracks formed and heal the bond coat. This provides a stable coating at high temperature that prolongs service life. The healing matrix may be somewhat rigid to maintain a stable coating structure. Although especially applicable to low thermal expansion composite substrates such as C/SiC, SiC/SiC or SiC/SiNC and monolithic Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, the architecture of the oxidation resistant bond coat layer is also applicable to other materials requiring oxidation protection over a broad temperature range to ensure optimal performance. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the oxidation resistant bond coat layer can be adjusted by varying the volume fraction and type of the metal silicide or other metallic or intermetallic network and healing silica or other glassy matrix to minimize CTE mismatch between the layers of the oxidation resistant bond coat layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a flowchart representing one process for applying the oxidation resistant bond coat layer may comprise mixing (step <b>10</b>) at least 10% by volume to up to 70% by volume of at least one silica or other glassy based material and at least 30% by volume to up to 90% by volume of at least one oxygen scavenger metal silicide or other metallic or intermetallic network in a liquid medium to form a slurry. In some examples, one or multiple silicide and boride powders (which operate as an oxygen scavenger/blocker) are mixed with silica containing matrix constituents, including at least one of the following: silica, silicon oxycarbide (SiOC), silicon carbide (SiC), aluminosilicate, borosilicate, alkaline earth metal oxides, glass, refractory metal oxides and rare earth metal oxides, to form the slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The metallic or intermetallic network may comprise metal silicides, aluminides, borides, refractory metals and combinations thereof. A metal silicide network may comprise a metal silicide or an alloy of multiple metal silicides and borides. The metal silicides, aluminides, and borides include, but are not limited to, transition metals, refractory metals, rare earth metals and mixtures thereof. The glassy or silica based healing matrix may include, but not be limited to, silica, aluminosilicate, borosilicate, alkaline earth oxides, glass, refractory metal and rare earth oxides, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Suitable liquid media includes, but is not limited to, water, alcohols, binders, terpineol, organic dispersants and solutions comprising the aforementioned materials, mixtures thereof, and the like. The aforementioned binders may be organic-based liquid media such as acrylic or inorganic-based liquid media such as colloidal silica.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Suitable silica based materials may comprise silica, modified silica, and the like. Modified silica may comprise silica modified by other compounds or elements, for example, silicates such as alkaline earth silicates, borosilicates, hafnium silicates, zirconium silicates, phosphates, glass, glass forming additives and mixtures thereof. The glass phases in silica based materials exhibit a viscosity of 10<sup>2 </sup>poise to 10<sup>7 </sup>poise in a temperature range of 1,292 F (700 C) to 3,272 F (1,800 C), to form a viscous glass phase material, that when heat treated, is suitable to heal cracks in the oxidation resistant bond coat. The silica based matrix surrounds and coats the oxygen scavenger network during the heat treatment steps to provide oxidation protection of the metallic or intermetallic network. The composite bond coat containing metallic or intermetallic network and silica based matrix has a rigid structure to resist creep at high temperatures. The oxidation resistant bond coat layer provides oxidation resistance by providing a barrier to oxygen flow to the article's surface, reacting with oxygen when small amount of oxygen diffused into the bond coat and healing of the bond coat cracks. In addition, as the oxidation resistant bond coat layer is exposed to oxidative operating conditions overtime, the oxidation resistant bond coat degrades and exposes the oxygen scavenger additive. The oxygen scavengers oxidize to form non-gaseous oxidation products such as metal oxides and SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The SiO<sub>2 </sub>is dense and protects the oxidation scavengers from further oxidation. B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>forms borosilicate glass phases and flows at elevated temperature to seal cracks and regenerates the glass phases in the silica based matrix, therefore prolong the life of the oxidation protective bond. The composite bond coat containing metallic or intermetallic network and healing silica based matrix accommodate mismatches of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the substrates and metallic or intermetallic materials in the bond coat layer. As a result, the oxidation resistant bond coat layer resists spallation and cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An oxygen scavenger may be defined to be any element, compound or multiphase component that reacts with oxygen to form a relatively stable, non-volatile oxygen-containing compound or phase. Suitable oxygen scavengers may comprise silicides, aluminides, and/or borides of molybdenum, tantalum, chromium, titanium, hafnium, zirconium, yttrium, mixtures thereof, and the like. In addition, other refractory, rare earth or transition metals, other metals or intermetallics, silicon and boron and mixtures thereof may also be utilized as suitable oxygen scavengers, including those that form silicides, aluminides, and borides. The volume % of the oxygen scavenger within the layers of coating may preferably be in the range of about 30% to about 90% by volume and more preferably in the range of about 50% to about 80% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, a viscosity modifier may be added to silica based matrix in an amount sufficient to rheologically control the viscosity of the targeted glass phase. Suitable viscosity modifiers may include, but are not limited to refractory materials, metal oxides, mixed metal silicates, mixtures thereof, and the like. The silica based material may also include, as part of its composition, the viscosity modifier additive. Suitable viscosity modifier additives may include mullite, alkaline earth aluminosilicates including barium strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS) and strontium aluminosilicate (SAS), yttrium silicates, rare earth silicates, hafnium or zirconium silicate, oxides of hafnium, zirconium, titanium, silicon, yttrium, refractory, transition, and rare earth metals, tantalum, niobium, aluminum and mixtures thereof, and the like. In addition, these viscosity modifier additives may also be used to impart additional steam resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Suitable mixing processes may include, but are not limited to, mechanical mixing techniques, manual mixing techniques, ultrasonics, cavitation, agitation, combinations comprising these techniques, and the like. For example, representative mechanical mixing techniques may include grinding, ball mixing, high energy milling (e.g., Spex), shear mixing, stirring, centrifugal mixing, combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, a substrate such as that manufactured of a ceramic matrix composite (CMC), is coated (step <b>12</b>) with the slurry. Any one or more of a number of coating techniques may be utilized. For example, suitable coating techniques may include, but are not limited to, thermal spraying, electrophoretic deposition, electrostatic deposition, preceramic polymer infiltration and pyrolysis, sol-gel, slurry coating, dipping, air-brushing, slurry painting or any combination thereof. In addition, suitable coating techniques may include high velocity oxygen fuel processes, low pressure plasma spray processes, and the like. When applying multiple layers of oxidation resistant bond coat layers, particularly suitable coating techniques include polymer impregnation processes, slurry coating, electrophoretic deposition, thermal spray, and combinations thereof. Each oxidation resistant bond coat layer should be disposed upon the article at a thickness of greater than or equal to 0.05 mils (0.00005 inch), preferably between 0.1 to 300 mils and ideally between 0.1 to 20 mils.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the slurry is applied, the organic binders/dispersant may form a film or residue upon the slurry coated substrate. If such residue remains, the slurry coated substrate may be dried (step <b>14</b>) such that the residue is dried or &#x201c;burned out.&#x201d; For example, the slurry coated substrate may be heated in air at 302 F (150 C) to 660 F (350 C) for 20 minutes to 60 minutes. Optionally, step <b>12</b> may be repeated as often as necessary to achieve the desired thickness, coating weight, other desired properties, and the like. The composition and microstructure of bond layer can be varied through the entire thickness of bond coat.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the slurry coated substrate may be heat treated in an inert atmosphere, such as argon, (step <b>16</b>) to form the healing silica matrix and metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network. The silica based material, oxygen scavenger, and optional alkaline earth material form a healing silica based matrix with the oxygen scavenger network interwound throughout the layer of the healing silica matrix. The heat treatment may be performed by any of a number of conventional techniques. The heat treatment temperature depends on the constituents of the slurry, and may range from 932 F (500 C) to 3,000 F (1,650 C). For example, a substrate coated with a slurry containing silica-based matrix materials and an oxygen scavenger may be heat treated in a temperature range of 2012 F (1100 C) to 2552 F (1400 C) for a period of time sufficient to form the healing silica matrix and metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network can be formed by sintering a uniform composition of metals, intermetallics, or metal silicides/borides or by reacting single or multiple metal constituents with silicon and metal borides under the inert atmosphere at a temperature below the melting temperature of silicon (e.g., about 2550 F; 1400 C). In some cases, chemical reactions may occur between the metals, intermetallics, or metal silicide/borides (oxygen scavenger) and the components in silica matrix materials at temperatures higher than 1150 C in inert atmosphere to form gaseous products such as SiO(g). The heat treatment temperatures, therefore, should be below the reaction temperature 2190 F (1200 C) to form healing silica based matrix only and avoid bond coat decomposition. A second heat treatment in air at temperatures higher than 2372 F (1300 C) is required to form the metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the slurry coated substrate is then subjected to a second heat treatment in air, (step <b>18</b>) to form metal silicide network when the first heat treatment in inert atmospheric is below 2372 F (1300 C). Not all the compositions need a second heat treatment in air, for example, when the first heat treatment were conducted at temperatures below 1350 C and the metal silicide would not otherwise form continuous network. The metals, intermetallics, or metal silicide sinter and form interconnected network in the healing silica matrix formed during the prior heat treatment (step <b>18</b>) in air at temperature in the range of 2372 F-3002 F (1300 C-1650 C). This heat treatment in air avoids the formation of gaseous reaction products such as SiO (g) between silicide and silica based matrix. The healing silica matrix formed during the prior heat treatment surrounds and coats the oxygen scavenger surface and protects it from oxidation during heat treatment in air.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network is formed through sintering of metal, intermetallic, or metal silicide particles. The silica formed on the surface of the metal, intermetallic, or metal silicide is dense and can protect the metal, intermetallic, or metal silicide from being quickly consumed thus increasing the longevity for the oxidation resistant bond coat layer. In one example, metal borides may be incorporated as part of the metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network. Metal borides may also reside in silica based matrix, outside of the network. Alternatively, the metal, intermetallic, or metal silicide network can be produced by silicide forming precursors, along with silica containing matrix constituents. The metals react with the silicon and boron/boride during heat treatment to form the metal, intermetallic, or metal silicide network that is embedded in the healing silica matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The silica based matrix operates as a sealant to slow oxygen diffusion and protect the metal silicide from oxidizing too quickly. Some metals, intermetallics, or metal silicides, such as molybdenum disilicide, can oxidize relatively quickly at 930-1650 F (500-900 C) due to insufficient formation of a protective scale such as silica at this temperature range. The silica based matrix provides protection in this temperature range and contains glass phases (e.g., borosilicate glass, alkaline earth aluminum silicate glass, etc.) to provide the healing. The volume ratio of the metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network in one embodiment is 30-90% by volume of the oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b>. The repetition need only be performed for steps <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to build coating thickness and/or incorporate varying bond coat compositions. Multiple top coat layers with varying compositions can be applied to achieve a desired environmental protection and thermal expansion match among the substrate, the oxidation protection coating, and the top coat.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an article <b>100</b> coated with the oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> of the present application is schematically illustrated. The article <b>100</b> may comprise any component, part of a component, etc., that requires protection from oxidation across a temperature range up to 3,000 F (1,650 C). Such articles may include, but are not limited to, turbine engine components such as vanes, blades, nozzles, flaps, seals, shrouds, and the like, hypersonic engine components such as leading edges and heat exchangers, and hypersonic components such as hypersonic airfoil surfaces, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The article <b>100</b> may be manufactured of any suitable material, such as, for example, silicon-containing substrates to include but not be limited to, silicon-containing ceramics, silicon-containing metal alloys, etc. Suitable silicon-containing ceramics include, but are not limited to, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silicon carbonitride, silicon oxycarbides, silicon carbide composites, silicon nitride composites, silicon oxynitrides, silicon aluminum oxynitrides, silicon nitride ceramic matrix composites, etc. Suitable silicon-containing metal alloys include, but are not limited to, molybdenum silicon alloys, niobium silicon alloys, iron silicon alloys, cobalt silicon alloys, nickel silicon alloys, tantalum silicon alloys, refractory metal silicides, etc. The article <b>100</b> may alternatively be manufactured of ceramic matrix composites, for example, ceramic fibers embedded in a ceramic matrix, thus forming a ceramic fiber reinforced ceramic. The matrix and fibers can comprise any ceramic material, whereby carbon and carbon fibers can also be considered a ceramic material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The article <b>100</b> may have at least one surface <b>102</b> of a substrate <b>104</b> upon which the oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> is disposed according to any of the processes described herein. In addition, the processes may be repeated so as to apply more than one layer of oxidation resistant bond coat layers <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network <b>142</b> and the healing silica matrix <b>144</b> are combined together to provide maximum oxidation protection for the CMC substrate. The metallic, intermetallic, or metal silicide network <b>142</b> is embedded in the healing silica matrix <b>144</b> such that the oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> readily binds strongly to the substrate <b>104</b> to provide coating structure stability against blow off and creep under high surface gas velocities and the forces generated in a gas turbine engine application. The oxygen scavengers dispersed throughout the resultant oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> circumvent potential problems associated with coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches which may result in spallation and cracking. The oxygen scavenger reacts with oxygen diffused into the oxygen resistant coating <b>120</b> and removes the oxygen. That is, the oxygen scavenger stops oxygen from reaching the substrate <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A top coat layer <b>130</b> may be applied (step <b>20</b>) upon the silica-based oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> to impart additional protection from oxidation or steam.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the oxidation resistant bond coat layer <b>120</b> is exposed to oxidative operating conditions, the oxidation resistant bond coat layer degrades and micro-cracks forms in the healing silica matrix <b>144</b>.

The metal oxide/metal silicates migrate at elevated temperature, to repair cracks <b>150</b> (illustrated schematically) in top coat <b>130</b>. The function of the top coat is to provide environmental protection against water vapor attack at high temperatures. The water vapor causes recession of silicon bearing materials at high temperatures Additional metal oxide/metal silicate phases are formed in situ for healing of the top coat layer <b>130</b> by incorporating non-volatile metal oxide/metal silicate forming phases, such as metal borides.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Example components in hypersonic and/or gas turbine applications require environmental protection in different conditions that may or may not include water vapor. For example, scramjet engine leading edges require dry oxidation resistance up to and greater than 3,000 F (1,650 C) while cooled CMC flow path components, e.g., heat exchangers, require protection under relatively high water vapor conditions. Multiple layers of the oxidation resistant bond coat layer of the present application may serve both purposes. Multiple layers may provide additional protection against steam and may be used to modify the heat flux through the oxidation resistant bond coat layers, e.g., modify emissivity, reflectance, etc.</p>
