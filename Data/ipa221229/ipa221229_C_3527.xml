<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a shielding device and a thin-film-deposition equipment with the same, which mainly employ shield members to cover a substrate carrier, in order to prevent polluting the carrier during a process of cleaning the reaction chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Thin-film-deposition equipments, such as chemical-vapor deposition (CVD), physical-vapor deposition (PVD) and the atomic-layer deposition (ALD) equipments, those are commonly employed in manufacturing process of semiconductors, light-emitting diodes and displays, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A thin-film-deposition equipment mainly includes a chamber and a substrate carrier, wherein the substrate carrier is within the chamber for carrying at least one substrate. To exemplify by PVD, a target material is required to dispose within the chamber, wherein the target material faces the substrate on the substrate carrier. When performing PVD, noble gas or reactive gas is transferred into the chamber, then bias electricity is applied on the target material and the substrate carrier respectively, also the substrate carried on by the substrate carrier is heated up.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The noble gas or reactive gas within the chamber transforms into ionized gas in effect of a high-voltage electric field, then the ionized gas is attracted by the bias electricity to bombard the target material. Thereby, atoms or molecules splashed from the target material are attracted by the bias electricity on the substrate carrier, then be deposited on surface of the substrate and forms a thin film on the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After some time of usage, an inner-edge surface of the chamber may also be formed with thin film, then a periodic cleaning is required to perform to the chamber, in order to prevent the waste thin film from dropping onto the substrate and causing pollution during the process of thin-film deposition. Moreover, surface of the target material may be formed with oxide or other pollutant, therefore requires a periodic cleaning as well. Generally, a burn-in process is applied to bombard the target material within the chamber by plasma ions, then to remove the oxides or pollutants on the surface of target material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To perform the abovementioned cleaning process, the substrate carrier and the substrate must be extracted or kept out, to prevent the removed pollutant from turning to pollute the substrate carrier and the substrate, during the cleaning process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
