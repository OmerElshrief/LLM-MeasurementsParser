<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present disclosure is related generally to multi-layered coating systems, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings, for a substrate, which include an adhesion layer between a metallic layer and a protective coating, and methods of making said multi-layered coating systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Decorative chrome plating has generally been used on plastic materials, such as plastic automotive components, in order to produce durable and aesthetically pleasing metallized coatings. However, the chrome plating process typically requires multiple steps and each step can require cleaning, polishing, buffing and rinsing. Furthermore, chrome plating is accomplished with hexavalent chromium, which, due to its high toxicity and classification as an air pollutant, requires that it must be handled and disposed of according to strict guidelines.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An alternative to chrome plating is the use of physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings for providing thin metallized layers on plastic components. PVD coatings typically include a basecoat provided on a plastic substrate, followed by the PVD metallized layer, and covered with a transparent topcoat. The basecoat and topcoat may be ultraviolet (UV) curable coatings. The PVD metallized layer, such as chromium and/or zirconium metal, can be deposited onto a plastic substrate through changes in the physical state of the metal (i.e., solid to gas to solid). The PVD metallized layer can be deposited by a variety of methods, for example, via thermal evaporation or sputtering. However, these PVD coatings do not have the required durability to replace chrome plating. Thus, further PVD coatings are needed with increased adhesion to the substrate to improve durability of the PVD coatings, especially after undergoing weathering and humidity exposure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to multi-layered coating systems and methods of making said multi-layered coating systems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain aspects, the present disclosure provides a multi-layered coating system for a substrate. The multi-layered coating system includes a substrate and a metallic layer, for example, a physical vapor deposition (PVD) layer, disposed adjacent to at least a portion of the substrate. The metallic layer includes a metal, an oxide of the metal, or a combination thereof. The metal can be selected from the group consisting of chromium, aluminum, zirconium, stainless steel, nickel, tin, indium, and a combination thereof. The multi-layered coating system further includes an adhesion layer disposed adjacent to at least a portion of the metallic layer, and a protective coating layer disposed adjacent to at least a portion of the adhesion layer. The adhesion layer includes a silicate, for example, a kaolin group mineral, and latex.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the primer layer and the protective coating layer can include a UV-cured polymer or a thermally cured polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet other aspects, the present disclosure provides a method of preparing a multi-layered coating system for a substrate. The method includes depositing a metallic layer via physical vapor deposition onto at least a portion of the substrate. The metallic layer includes a metal, an oxide of the metal, or a combination thereof. The metal may be selected from the group consisting of chromium, aluminum, zirconium, stainless steel, nickel, tin, indium, and a combination thereof. The method may further include applying an adhesion layer onto at least a portion of the metallic layer, and applying a protective coating layer precursor onto at least a portion of the adhesion layer. The adhesion layer includes a silicate, for example, a kaolin group mineral, and latex. The method may further include cross-linking and/or solidifying the protective coating layer precursor to form a protective coating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The silicate may be present in the adhesion layer in an amount of greater than about 50 wt %, based on total weight of the adhesion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The metallic layer may have a thickness of about 50 nm to about 500 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific compositions, components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, elements, compositions, steps, integers, operations, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. Although the open-ended term &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; is to be understood as a non-restrictive term used to describe and claim various embodiments set forth herein, in certain aspects, the term may alternatively be understood to instead be a more limiting and restrictive term, such as &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; or&#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; Thus, for any given embodiment reciting compositions, materials, components, elements, features, integers, operations, and/or process steps, the present disclosure also specifically includes embodiments consisting of, or consisting essentially of, such recited compositions, materials, components, elements, features, integers, operations, and/or process steps. In the case of &#x201c;consisting of,&#x201d; the alternative embodiment excludes any additional compositions, materials, components, elements, features, integers, operations, and/or process steps, while in the case of &#x201c;consisting essentially of,&#x201d; any additional compositions, materials, components, elements, features, integers, operations, and/or process steps that materially affect the basic and novel characteristics are excluded from such an embodiment, but any compositions, materials, components, elements, features, integers, operations, and/or process steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics can be included in the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Any method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When a component, element, or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other component, element, or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.). As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various steps, elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these steps, elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms, unless otherwise indicated. These terms may be only used to distinguish one step, element, component, region, layer or section from another step, element, component, region, layer or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first step, element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second step, element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Spatially or temporally relative terms, such as &#x201c;before,&#x201d; &#x201c;after,&#x201d; &#x201c;inner,&#x201d; &#x201c;outer,&#x201d; &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially or temporally relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device or system in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Throughout this disclosure, the numerical values represent approximate measures or limits to ranges to encompass minor deviations from the given values and embodiments having about the value mentioned as well as those having exactly the value mentioned. Other than in the working examples provided at the end of the detailed description, all numerical values of parameters (e.g., of quantities or conditions) in this specification, including the appended claims, are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; whether or not &#x201c;about&#x201d; actually appears before the numerical value. &#x201c;About&#x201d; indicates that the stated numerical value allows some slight imprecision (with some approach to exactness in the value; approximately or reasonably close to the value; nearly). If the imprecision provided by &#x201c;about&#x201d; is not otherwise understood in the art with this ordinary meaning, then &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein indicates at least variations that may arise from ordinary methods of measuring and using such parameters. For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; may comprise a variation of less than or equal to 5%, optionally less than or equal to 4%, optionally less than or equal to 3%, optionally less than or equal to 2%, optionally less than or equal to 1%, optionally less than or equal to 0.5%, and in certain aspects, optionally less than or equal to 0.1%.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">II. Methods for Preparing a Multi-Layered Coating System</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Methods for preparing a multi-layered coating system, such as coating system <b>10</b>, for a substrate, such as substrate <b>20</b>, are provided herein. A method includes depositing a metallic layer as described herein (e.g., metallic layer <b>40</b>) via physical vapor deposition (PVD) onto at least a portion of the substrate (e.g., substrate <b>20</b>). PVD refers to techniques utilizing physical methods for depositing metal films or coatings. PVD is characterized by a process in which the material goes from a condensed phase to a vapor phase and then back to a thin film condensed phase. The metallic layer may include a metal as described herein (e.g., chromium, aluminum, zirconium, stainless steel, nickel, tin, and a combination thereof), an oxide of the metal as described herein, or a combination thereof. Optionally, the method may include applying a primer layer precursor onto at least a portion of a substrate as described herein (e.g., substrate <b>20</b>) and depositing a metallic layer as described herein (e.g., metallic layer <b>40</b> via physical vapor deposition onto at least a portion of the primer layer precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method may further include applying an adhesion layer as described herein (e.g., adhesion layer <b>50</b>) onto at least a portion of the metallic layer, and applying a protective coating layer precursor onto at least a portion of the adhesion layer. The primer layer precursor, if present, and the protecting coating layer precursor each may be cross-linked and/or solidified to form a primer layer as described herein (e.g., primer layer <b>30</b>) and a protective coating layer as described herein (e.g., protective coating layer <b>60</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Any suitable PVD method known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used to deposit the metallic layer. For example, thermal evaporation or sputtering techniques, which both may be performed in a vacuum, can be used to deposit the metallic layer. The thermal evaporation process is a deposition of a metal via thermal vaporization in a vacuum environment. The metal may be in the form of a cane, which can be placed inside a metal coil, such as a tungsten coil. The number of coils can vary depending on size of the chamber. Once a vacuum is established in the chamber, the metal filaments (e.g., tungsten filaments) are heated to a temperature high enough to melt the metal. The power to the filaments is then increased further, for example, about double the temperature, and the metal is evaporated. The metal then re-condenses to form the metallic layer on the parts, for example, a substrate as described herein, optionally, including the primer layer precursor as described herein, in the chamber. Thickness of the metallic layer can vary depending on the cycle time and power applied to the target.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sputtering process is a deposition process where atoms on a solid metal target are ejected into the gas phase due to bombardment of the material by high energy ions. The bombardment releases atoms from the metal target, which are deposited directly onto the part, for example, a substrate as described herein, optionally, including the primer layer precursor as described herein, within the vacuum chamber. Alloys can be deposited via thermal evaporation or sputtering. However, with thermal evaporation, the first metal with the lowest melt temperature will evaporate first and deposit first followed by the second metal with the higher melt temperature to form two distinct metal layers.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In any embodiment, the adhesion layer may be applied via spraying onto the metallic layer. For example, a slurry or solution including a silicate as described herein and latex as described herein with a suitable solvent may be sprayed onto the metallic layer. The adhesion layer may be sprayed by conventional painting techniques, for example, with a spray gun or bell, with or without the use of electrostatics. The adhesion layer may be applied in an inert atmosphere and undergo drying for a suitable amount of time at a suitable temperature to remove the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Both the primer layer (e.g., primer layer <b>30</b>) (if present) and the protective coating layer (e.g., protective coating layer <b>60</b>) may be formed by conventional polymerization techniques known by those of ordinary skill in the art. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;primer layer precursor&#x201d; and &#x201c;protective coating layer precursor&#x201d; refer to the pre-polymers, oligomers, monomers, or monomer or oligomer systems that can form any one of the UV-cured polymers or thermally cured polymers as disclosed above. For example, to form a primer layer including a UV-cured polymer or a protective coating layer including a UV-cured polymer, each of the primer layer precursor and the protective coating layer precursor may include monomers (e.g., epoxy, polyester, urethane, silicone, polyether, and/or styrene) and acrylate oligomers along with a photo-polymerization initiator. In another example, to form a primer layer including a thermally cured polymer, such as polyurethane, or a protective coating layer including a thermally cured polymer, such as polyurethane, each of the primer layer precursor and the protective coating layer precursor may include a polyol and a cross-linking agent (e.g., isocyanate) along with a catalyst (e.g., tertiary amine). The primer layer precursor may be applied to a substrate as described herein, and the protective coating layer precursor may be applied to the adhesion layer as described herein. For example, application can include spraying or casting of the precursors. Following application, solidifying and/or cross-linking of the primer layer precursor and/or the protective coating layer precursor can be accomplished by applying UV radiation to the primer layer precursor and/or the protective coating layer, for example, to form a UV-cured polymer, or by applying heat (e.g., in an oven) to form the primer layer precursor and/or the protective coating layer, for example, to form a thermally cured polymer. It is contemplated herein that the primer layer precursor and the protective coating layer precursor can be solidified and/or cross-linked via the same process (e.g., via heating or UV radiation) at the same time or at different times. For example, both the primer layer precursor and the protective coating layer precursor may be solidified and/or cross-linked via heating at substantially the same time or in sequential steps. Alternatively, the primer layer precursor and the protective coating layer precursor can be solidified and/or cross-linked via different processes (e.g., via heating or UV radiation) at different times. For example, the primer layer precursor may be solidified and/or cross-linked via heating followed by solidifying and/or cross-linking the protective coating layer precursor via exposure to UV radiation. Also, it is contemplated herein that the protective coating layer precursor and optional primer layer precursor, can be solidified and/or cross-linked at the same time via the same process (e.g., heating) as the adhesion layer. Alternatively, the adhesion layer may be heated/dried and followed by application and solidifying and/or cross-linking of the protective coating precursor.</p>

Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described.
