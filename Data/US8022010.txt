U
 presence of excess oxygen. In this case, the catalyst/NOX 
 sorbent is effective for storing NOx. As in the case of the gasoline partial lean burn application, after the NOX storage 
 mode, a transient rich condition must be utilized to releasef 
 reduce the stored NOx to nitrogen. In the case of the diesel engine, this transient reducing condition will require unique 
 engine calibration or injection of a diesel fuel into the exhaust 
 to create the next reducing environment. 
 NOX storage (sorbent) components including alkaline 
 earth metal oxides, such as oxides of Mg, Ca,Srand Ba, alkali 
 metal oxides such as oxides of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, and rare 
 earth metal oxides such as oxides of Ce, La, Pr and Nd in 
 combination with precious metal catalysts such as platinum 
 dispersed on an alumina Support have been used in the puri 
 fication of exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine. 
 For NOx storage, baria is usually preferred because it forms 
 nitrates at lean engine operation and releases the nitrates 
 relatively easily under rich conditions. However, catalysts 
 that use baria for NOx storage exhibit a problem in practical application, particularly when the catalysts are aged by expo 
 Sure to high temperatures and lean operating conditions. After 
 Such exposure, such catalysts show a marked decrease in 
 catalytic activity for NOx reduction, particularly at low tem 
 perature (200 to 350° C.) and high temperature (450° C. to 
 600° C.) operating conditions. In addition, NOx absorbents 
 that include baria suffer from the disadvantage that when exposed to temperatures above 450° C. in the presence of 
 CO, barium carbonate forms, which becomes more stable 
 than barium nitrate. Furthermore, barium tends to sinter and to form composite compounds with Support materials, which 
 leads to the loss of NOx storage capacity. 
 NOX storage materials comprising barium fixed to ceria 
 particles have been reported, and these NOx materials have exhibited improved thermal aging properties compared to the 
 catalyst materials described above. Despite these improve 
 ments, there is an ongoing need to improve the performance 
 of NOx storage materials, particularly the ability of these 
 materials to operate over a wide temperature range and to operate effectively after exposure to high temperature. It is 
 also desirable to improve the kinetics of NOx oxidation (re quired in advance of NOx storage) and the kinetics of NOx reduction (required following NOx release). Thus, there is a 
 need to provide improved NOx storage materials and meth 
 ods for their manufacture.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 Before describing several exemplary embodiments of the 
 invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not 
 limited to the details of construction or process steps set forth in the following description. The invention is capable of other 
 embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in 
 various ways. 
 In one embodiment of the invention, a spray-dried NOx 
 storage material comprising alkaline earth carbonate or mix 
 tures of carbonates, for example, BaCO, or mixtures of BaCO and MgCO supported on CeO particles is provided.

 lean burn engine. The NOX storage material according to 
 embodiments of the present invention demonstrates improved NOX storage capacity after thermal aging when 
 used in a catalytic trap. 
 According other embodiments of the invention, methods of manufacturing NOx storage materials and catalytic traps 
 including these storage materials are provided. Other 
 embodiments of the invention pertain to a catalytic trap for 
 abatement of NOX in an exhaust gas stream which is gener 
 ated by an internal combustion engine which is operated 
 periodically between lean and stoichiometric or rich condi 
 tions. According to one or more embodiments, the catalytic trap comprises a catalytic trap material including a catalytic 
 component effective for promoting the reduction of NOx 
 understoichiometric or rich conditions Supported on a refrac 
 tory metal oxide and a NOx storage material effective for 
 adsorbing the NOX underlean conditions and desorbing and 
 reducing the NOx to nitrogen under stoichiometric or rich 
 conditions, the NOX storage material comprising spray-dried 
 particles of ceria having alkaline earth carbonate, for 
 example, barium carbonate, Supported on the ceria particles, 
 the catalytic trap material being disposed on a refractory 
 carrier member. 
 Embodiments of this invention pertain to a process for 
 abatement of NOX in an exhaust gas stream generated by an 
 internal combustion engine which periodically operates alter 
 nately between lean and stoichiometric or rich conditions, comprising locating the above-described catalytic trap in an 
 exhaust passage of the engine and treating the exhaust gas 
 stream with a catalytic trap whereby at least some of the NOx 
 in the exhaust gas stream is adsorbed by the catalytic trap 
 during the periods of lean conditions and is desorbed from the catalytic trap and reduced to nitrogen during the periods of 
 Stoichiometric or rich conditions. 
 The refractory metal oxide support of the catalytic trap 
 may be porous in nature and has a high Surface area Such as alumina, for example, gamma-alumina. Other Suitable Sup 
 port materials include titania, titania-alumina, Zirconia, Zir 
 conia-alumina, baria-alumina, lanthana-alumina, lanthana 
 Zirconia-alumina titania-Zirconia, and mixtures thereof. 
 Desirably, the refractory metal oxide support will have a surface area of between about 5 and about 350 m?g, and more particularly between about 100 and 200 m/g. Typically, the 
 Support will be present on the coated Substrate in the amount of about 1.5 to about 7.0 g/in, for example between about 3 and 6 g/in. A suitable support material for the precious metal 
 is alumina, which may be doped with one or more other 
 materials. Alumina having a BET surface area of about 200 m/g and doped with 10%-30% ZrO, and 1%-4% Lao pro 
 vided good results. 
 In one or more embodiments of the present invention the catalytic component preferably comprises a precious metal 
 component, i.e., a platinum group metal component. Suitable precious metal components include platinum, palladium, 
 rhodium and mixtures thereof. The catalytic component will 
 typically be present in an amount of about 20 to about 200 g/ft, more specifically, about 60 to 120 g/ft. 
 The NOx storage material employed in the catalytic trap 
 according to embodiments of the present invention comprises a spray-dried NOX storage material comprising BaCO Sup ported on CeO particles. 
 In one or more embodiments, the catalytic trap is disposed 
 on a refractory carrier member. Examples of Such Substrates 
 include, for example, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum Zir 
 conate, aluminum titanate, aluminum phosphate, cordierite, US 8,022,010 B2 
 5 
 mullite and corundum. The carrier member may be employed as a monolithic honeycomb structure, spun fibers, corrugated 
 foils, layered materials, etc. In a gasoline vehicle application, a catalytic device 
 employing a three-way conversion (“TWC) catalyst may be 
 used in conjunction with the catalytic trap of the invention. 
 Such a device will be located in an exhaust passage of the internal combustion engine and will be disposed upstream 
 and/or downstream of the catalytic trap. The TWC catalyst would typically include platinum, palladium and rhodium 
 catalytic components dispersed on a high Surface area refrac 
 tory Support and may also contain one or more base metal oxide catalytic components such as oxides of iron, manga 
 nese or nickel. Such catalysts can be stabilized against ther mal degradation by expedients such as impregnating an acti 
 vated alumina Support with one or more rare earth metal oxides, e.g., ceria. Such stabilized catalysts can Sustain very high operating temperatures. For example, if a fuel cut tech 
 nique is utilized, temperatures as high as 1050° C. may be 
 Sustained in the catalytic device. If the catalytic device is employed and is located upstream 
 of the catalytic trap of the invention, the catalytic device 
 would be mounted close to the exhaust manifold of the 
 engine. In Such an arrangement, the TWC catalyst would 
 warm up quickly and provide for efficient cold startemission control. Once the engine is warmed up, the TWC catalyst will 
 remove HC, CO and NOx from the exhaust gas stream during stoichiometric or rich operation and HC and CO during lean operation. The catalytic trap of the invention would be posi 
 tioned downstream of the catalytic device where the exhaust gas temperature enables maximum NOX trap efficiency. Dur ing periods of lean engine operation, when NOx passes 
 through the TWC catalyst, NOx is stored on the catalytic trap. 
 The catalytic trap is periodically desorbed and the NOx is 
 reduced to nitrogen under periods of Stoichiometric or rich engine operation. If desired, a catalytic device containing a 
 TWC catalyst may be employed downstream of the catalytic 
 trap of the invention. Such catalytic device will serve to 
 remove further amounts of HC and CO from the exhaust gas stream and, in particular, will provide for efficient reduction 
 of the NOx to nitrogen under periods of stoichiometric or rich engine operation. 
 In a diesel vehicle application, the catalytic NOx-trap 
 according to embodiments of the invention may be used in conjunction with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), and a 
 catalyzed soot filter (CSF); where the DOC and CSF are placed either before or after the catalytic device of this inven 
 tion. In another embodiment of the invention, it is possible to place the NOx-trap catalyst directly onto the filter media. 
 The several components of the catalytic trap material may 
 be applied to the refractory carrier member, i.e., the substrate, 
 as a mixture of two or more components or as individual components in sequential steps in a manner which will be 
 readily apparent to those skilled in the art of catalyst manu facture. A typical method of manufacturing the catalytic trap 
 of the present invention is to provide the catalytic trap mate 
 rial as a coating or layer of washcoat on the walls of the gas-flow passages of a suitable carrier member. This may be accomplished, by impregnating a fine particulate refractory 
 metal oxide Support material, e.g., gamma alumina, with one or more catalytic metal components such as a precious metal, 
 i.e., platinum group, compound or other noble metals or base metals, drying and calcining the impregnated Support par 
 ticles and forming an aqueous slurry of these particles. Spray 
 dried particles of the bulkNOx sorbent may be included in the slurry. Alternatively, the NOx storage material or sorbent may be dispersed into the Support, preferably in an impregnation 10

 operation, as described below. Activated alumina may be thermally stabilized before the catalytic components are dis 
 persed thereon, as is well known in the art, by impregnating it 
 with, e.g., a Solution of a soluble salt of barium, lanthanum, zirconium, rare earth metal or other suitable stabilizer precur 
 Sor, and thereafter drying (e.g., at 110° C. for one hour) and calcining (e.g., at 550° C. for one hour) the impregnated 
 activated alumina to form a stabilizing metal oxide dispersed onto the alumina. Base metal catalysts may optionally also 
 have been impregnated into the activated alumina, for example, by impregnating a solution of a base metal nitrate into the alumina particles and calcining to provide a base 
 metal oxide dispersed in the alumina particles. 
 The carrier may then be immersed into the slurry of impregnated activated alumina and excess slurry removed to provide a thin coating of the slurry on the walls of the gas-flow 
 passages of the carrier. The coated carrier is then dried and calcined to provide an adherent coating of the catalytic com ponent and, optionally, the catalytic trap material, to the walls 
 of the passages thereof. The carrier may then be immersed into a slurry offine particles of component of the NOx storage 
 material as a second or overlayer coating deposited over the layer of catalytic component. A magnesium component, e.g., 
 a solution of a magnesium salt Such as magnesium nitrate, 
 acetate, Sulfate, hydroxide, etc., may be combined with the slurry of component of the NOx storage material or it may be applied as a third or overlayer coating deposited over the 
 second layer of the NOx storage material. The carrier is then dried and calcined to provide a finished catalyst trap member 
 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Alternatively, the alumina or other Support particles 
 impregnated with the catalytic component may be mixed with 
 bulk or supported particles of the NOx storage material in an aqueous slurry, and this mixed slurry of catalytic component 
 particles and NOX storage material particles may be applied 
 as a coating to the walls of the gas-flow passages of the carrier. Preferably, however, for improved dispersion of the NOx 
 storage material, the washcoat of catalytic component mate 
 rial, after being dried and calcined, is immersed (post-dipped) into a solution of a component (NOX storage material precur Sor compound (or complex) and a magnesium precursor.com 
 pound (or complex) to impregnate the washcoat with the NOx 
 storage material precursor. The impregnated washcoat is then 
 dried and calcined to provide the NOx storage material dis persed throughout the washcoat. 
 Separate discrete layers of washcoat may be applied in Successive impregnating/drying/calcining operations, e.g., to 
 provide a bottom washcoat layer containing a platinum cata 
 lytic component in a bottom washcoat layer and a palladium 
 and/or rhodium catalytic component in a top washcoat layer. The NOX storage material may be dispersed by impregnation 
 into both the top and bottom layers. 
 In use, the exhaust gas stream which is contacted with the catalytic trap of the present invention is alternately adjusted 
 between lean and Stoichiometric/rich operating conditions so as to provide alternating lean operating periods and stoichio 
 metric/rich operating periods. It will be understood that the 
 exhaust gas stream being treated may be selectively rendered 
 lean or stoichiometric/rich either by adjusting the air-to-fuel ratio fed to the engine generating the exhaust or by periodi 
 cally injecting a reductant into the gas stream upstream of the catalytic trap. For example, the composition of the present 
 invention is well Suited to treat the exhaust of engines, includ ing diesel engines, which continuously run lean. In Such case, 
 in order to establish a stoichiometric/rich operating period, a Suitable reductant, such as fuel, may be periodically sprayed into the exhaust immediately upstream of the catalytic trap of US 8,022,010 B2 
 7 
 the present invention to provide at least local (at the catalytic 
 trap) stoichiometric/rich conditions at selected intervals. Par tial lean-burn engines, such as partial lean-burn gasoline 
 engines, are designed with controls which cause them to 
 operate lean with brief, intermittent rich or stoichiometric 
 conditions. 
 Without intending to limit the invention in any manner, 
 embodiments of the present invention will be more fully described by the following examples. 
 EXAMPLES 
 Example 1 
 Preparation of NOx Storage Material 
 BaCO, and CeO, were intimately mixed and finely dis 
 persed in a weight ratio of between about 1:3 and about 1:5. 
 Cerium oxide having a BET surface area of between about 50-150 m/g was mixed with a solution of barium acetate 
 such that the BaCO/CeO composite had a BaCO3 content of about 10-30 wt %. After mixing, the suspension of soluble 
 barium acetate and CeO2 was then spray-dried at a tempera 
 ture of between about 90° C. and 120° C. to obtain a solid 
 mixture of barium acetate and ceria. 
 After spray-drying, the mixture was then heated at about 
 550° C. to 800° C. for about 2 hours to form particles of ceria having barium carbonate Supported on the ceria particles. The 
 resulting BaCO3 had a crystallite size of between about 20 
 and 40 nm. The BaCO and CeO crystallites formed particles 
 with a size of between about 5 and 50 microns. The BET 
 surface area of the particulate mixture is between about 30 and 80 m/g. Preparation of Catalytic Component 
 To provide a fully formulated NOx storage catalyst or 
 catalytic trap as described above, in addition to the manufac 
 ture of barium carbonate Supported onceria, a precious metal can be Supported on a refractory oxide according to the fol 
 lowing description. Pt and Rhare impregnated onto Al-O by an incipient wetness procedure to yield 1.8 weight percent Pt 
 and 0.1 weight percent Rh. Pd is impregnated separately onto 
 alumina to a Pd loading of 1.4 weight percent. 
 A slurry mixture containing about 34 wt % of alumina 
 previously mixed with Pt/Rh, about 9 wt % Pd on alumina, a 
 solution of zirconium acetate with a content of about 3 wt % 
 ZrO, magnesium acetate to yield 9 wt % MgO, and 45 wt % BaCO/CeO, spray-dried powder is milled at pH 6-8 until a 
 particle size of 11 micron (Do) is obtained. Coating of a Substrate 
 Ceramic or metallic honeycomb substrates are coated with the slurry in a dip coating manner and then dried in a dryer and 
 subsequently calcined in a furnace under air at about 450° C.-550° C. The coating procedure is then repeated until a loading of about 4-6.5 g/in is achieved. The coating on the honeycomb catalyst comprises about 3-30 micron BaCO/ 
 CeO particles and about 1-20 micron alumina particles. 
 BaCO, is fixed within the pores of the ceria particles in such a way that it does not migrate to the alumina particles. It is 
 believed that the contact of BaCO, and alumina would lead to the formation of inactive BaAl2O composite compound for 
 mation upon aging, which has a reduced NOX storage capac ity compared to BaCO.

 NOx Storage Capacity Testing 
 Two catalytic traps were prepared, a first catalytic trap was prepared in accordance with Example 1 and a comparative catalytic trap was prepared in accordance with Comparative Example 2. Both catalytic traps A were evaluated after aging 
 for 8 hours at 850° C. 
 Both catalytic traps were evaluated as follows. An engine 
 was set to an air/fuel ratio of 11.6 for 2 minutes at the desired 
 temperature to remove all stored NOx and oxygen from the catalyst. This mode represents rich engine operation. Subse quently, the engine was adjusted to an air/fuel ratio of 29.6 
 under constant NOx mass flow. This mode represents lean engine operation. During the whole test, the NOX concentra 
 tion was measured before and after the NOx trap using a NOx analyzer.

 After the 2 minute rich operation followed by a 60 second lean operation, the engine was set to a 3 second rich operation to remove stored NOx without having hydrocarbon and car bon monoxide tailpipe emissions. This 60 sec lean/3 sec rich cycle is repeated 10 times to establish constant catalyst con ditions. For the time period of the 10 lean/rich cycles the NOx efficiency (U) is calculated from the NOx inlet and NOx outlet concentrations via equation (1): NOX storage massing is calculated via equation (2): 
 NOX=NOx concentration (ppm) 
 V=volume flow (m3/h) Videal molar volume (1/mol) at STP M=Molar weight of NO2 (g/mol) 
 dt-time interval(s) After the 10 lean/rich cycles, the engine is operated for 1 minrich to remove the stored NOx completely. Subsequently, 
 the engine is operated under lean condition until no more NOx is stored in the trap. Under these conditions, the overall NOx storage capacity is evaluated. However, to achieve a NOx conversion of greater than 80%, the NOx storage capac ity at high NOx efficiency is decisive. FIG. 1 demonstrates that the NOX storage capacity of catalytic trap prepared in accordance with Example 1 utilizing a spray-drying process exhibited Superior capacity compared to the Comparative 
 reference Example.

 Barium Concentration and Calcination Temperature 
 Different amounts of Ba were impregnated into ceria of different Surface area, using the procedures described in Example 1. Ceria powders with different BET surface areas 
 were used to determine the effect of the resulting Ba/Ceria composite powder. 
 Characterization of the impregnated powder included BET 
 surface area measurement. In addition fully formulated NOx trap catalysts were prepared using the procedures described in Example 1 that contain the particular Ba/Ceria composite material as NOX storage component. The NOX storage prop 
 erties of the catalysts have been evaluated after aging for 8 hours at 850° C. under air with 10% HO in a laboratory 
 reactor. The results are shown in Table I and Table II below. 
 Table I shows the result of a variation of the BaCO and CeO concentration together with a variation of the ceria used. After impregnation, all samples were calcined at US 8,022

 After 800° C. aging, the highest NOx storage activity at 
 400° C. is obtained with sample C, having a medium Ba 
 concentration and a CeO2 material with a medium BET sur face area and crystallinity. A high BET surface area and 25 
 relative low Ba concentration is especially beneficial for NOx storage at 300° C. It is particularly interesting that sample D 
 having the largest BaCO crystallite size after agingyields the 
 best NOx storage at low temperature. In addition, increased Ba concentration resulted in decreased BET surface area and " 
 increase in CeO crystal size. 0 1 0 B2 9

 In order to determine an optimum BaCO/CeO compos 
 ite, the Ba/CeO is calcined after Ba impregnation at different temperatures. This is done to decompose the Ba precursor to 
 the carbonate and to conditioning the composite for optimum 
 NOx adsorption capacity. The data in Table II demonstrates 
 that a calcination temperature between 550 and 750° C. after 
 impregnation of Ba onto CeO, provided the best results for 
 NOx storage. The samples calcined within this temperature 
 range had higher surface area and exhibited higher NOx 
 storage after aging than a sample calcined at 850° C. Further 
 more, a BaCO crystallite size of between about 20-50 nm, for example, 45 nm, and a CeO crystallite size of between 
 about 25-30 nm in combination with a sufficient BET surface 
 area after aging yielded the highest NOx storage at 400° C. 55

 Ceria Type and Doping 
 Various types of ceria and doping with different materials 
 were evaluated for effect on BET surface area and decompo 
 sition temperature of the barium carbonate. The decomposi 
 tion temperature is the temperature at which Ba reacts with 
 ceria to form BaCeO. The samples below were prepared by an incipient wetness preparation instead of spray-drying prior 
 to calcination. The results are shown in Table III: US 8,022,010 B2

 to a level of 10% does not influence the decomposition tem perature of BaCO. Only sample D with 28% La has a much lower temperature of BaCO decomposition while sample C 
 even with 43% of Pr has a high resistance towards reaction 
 with BaCO. The preferred BaCO/CeOfdopandmaterial should have a BET surface area-10 m/g after aging and a high resistance 
 towards reaction to BaCO as shown in table III.

 Precious Metal Support 
 Various alumina supports were evaluated for stability. It 
 was found that the Support material for the precious metal 
 tends to react with BaCO, at a certain temperature. If this temperature for a specific material is reached most or all of the 25

 40 BaCO3 has formed a compound with the support material and 
 this compound has much diminished tendency to adsorb NOx 
 compared to BaCO. 
 The table below shows a list of different support materials 
 derived from ZrO, or Al-O. Materials A and B show higher BaCO decomposition temperature than pure or La, Ba or 
 ZrO doped aluminas. However the surface area of those materials is relatively small compared to other doped or 
 undoped materials. Furthermore, it was found that the higher the Surface area of a material in presence of Ba the higher is the NOX storage capacity of an aged catalyst containing this 
 material. 
 In particular, it was found that ZrO doped aluminas and also La and ZrO doped materials have very thermally stable 
 surface areas in presence of Ba. The preferred alumina should have a BET surface area of 150-250 m/g, a pore volume of 0.3-0.8 ml/g an average pore size of 3-20 nm.
